### Now

_Last updated 5th July 2016_

Just moved into a rental house in [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney){:target="_blank"}, still trying to fit a square peg (stuff) into a round hole (different house). Working on Sydney Light Rail for [GHD](http://www.ghd.com/ghd-australia/){:target="_blank"}, managing the Construction Phase Services for the design. Enjoying learning more about design (consultancy) side.
