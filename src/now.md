### Now

_Last updated 8th June 2016_

I am currently living out of a suit case in [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney){:target="_blank"}, waiting for the keys to our new rental. While working as a Project Manager for [GHD](http://www.ghd.com/ghd-australia/){:target="_blank"} in there Major Projects team.

### Books
*Books I'm reading and why:*

* <a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845572/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591845572&linkCode=as2&tag=iate-20&linkId=MHHNJLA27D53GDOO">The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business</a> -- Learning about business. Nugget, after nugget of gold in this one. Had to press pause to take it all in.

* <a  href="http://amzn.to/1WDOPwb">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a> -- In business there are no easy answers.

* <a  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553418025/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553418025&linkCode=as2&tag=iate-20&linkId=HDFTLKB4SLZGJD7L">The Martian</a> -- Seeing what all the hype is about.

### Projects

*This page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) and his work at [http://nownownow.com/](http://nownownow.com/). Most Websites (personal and professional) have an [about](about.html) page to let you know what they are about, funny that. A __now__ page is a way of letting visitors know what I am spending my time on right now.*
