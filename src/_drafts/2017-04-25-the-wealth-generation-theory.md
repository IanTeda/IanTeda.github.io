Money is a lot like religion and politics. Everyone believes they have the one truth. But the reality is, there are many paths and each is as valid as the other. It all depends on your version of reality. With that said, I wrote this post to put to text my theory around money and Wealth Generation.

I always try and keep things simple. Keeping things simple is hard, takes work, takes compromises. But the flip side it is easier to implement, stick to and explain.

I have attempted to apply the KISS — Keep It Simple Stupid — principle as much as possible. Based mostly around the principals of the following texts.
