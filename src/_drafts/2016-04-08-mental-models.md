Mental models are a simplification of how the world around us works. Our brains use them to make sense of things. They are an [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) of reality, a simplification of an incomprehensibly complicated world. They need to simply because of our limited cognitive capabilities and brain power.

Mental models are a set of tools (maps) our brains use to think and make decisions. A personal algorithm to process and make sense of the world around us. We use them to predict the results of our (or other peoples) actions. Since they are a simplifications they don't always hold true for all situations, contexts or moment in time. Because they represent (model) what is explicitly true, but not what is explicitly false. The world around us is continually changes, so should our mental models.

Mental models are formed either through direct, or shared experience. They can be seen in our prejudices, beliefs, folklore and proverbs. Why do people with more experience get the job? Because they have more mental models to guide them. When your set of mental models is limited, so is your potential for finding a solution.

> The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system.
> <cite> -- Jay Wright Forrester</cite>

The decision maker without a mental model to apply is overwhelmed [^creative-advatage], we cannot function without them. We abstract away complexity and understanding when we hire a plumber, visit a doctor or hirer a lawyer. Why? Because it would take a long time to retain all the knowledge and skills needed. It is the same with mental models.

Over at [Creative Advantage](http://www.createadvantage.com/glossary/mental-model) they list four general problems to be aware of with mental models and their use:

* First, they can be wrong because they are limited by the simplifications that made them useful
* Second, they can be improperly used
* Third, they can lead to wrong answers if fed by incorrect information
* Fourth, their effectiveness is rarely assessed.

The more you master a single mental model, the more likely this mental model will be your downfall. Knowledge is about connections, connections between mental models. Wisdom is the application of knowledge.
