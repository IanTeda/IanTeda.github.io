> Man seeks for himself a simplified and lucid image of the world.

> The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system.
> <cite> -- Jay Wright Forrester</cite>

### Promise (why)
Mental models are a simplification of how the world around us works. They are an [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) of reality. We abstract away complexity and understanding when we hire a plumber, visit a doctor or hirer a lawyer.

A model is an abstraction or simplification of a system

Being simplifications they don't hold true for all situations, contexts or time. But they don't need to correct all of the time to be useful. They simplify the world without ignoring useful information.

The model is less complex than the real world. If you do this, this happens.

The decision maker without mental models to apply is overwhelmed [^creative-advatage], we cannot function without them.

They simplify an incomprehensibly complicated world. The need to simplify arises from our limited cognitive capacities.

They help us determine how to take advantage of opportunities and how to hedge risks. They help us spot problems and work out solutions. Mental models and the rules of conduct generated from them-whether explicit or implicit-are at the core of most man- agers' reasoning processes.

There are four general problems associated with mental models and their use: First, they can be wrong because they are limited by the simplifications that made them useful. Second, they can be improperly used. Third, they can lead to wrong answers if fed by incorrect information. And fourth, their effectiveness is rarely assessed

Mental models represent explicitly what is true, but not what is false.

Mental models are formed either through direct, or shared experience.

Mental models are the set of tools that you use to think.

A lot mental models can be found in proverbs "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail". When your set of mental models is limited, so is your potential for finding a solution. The more you master a single mental model, the more likely it becomes that this mental model will be your downfall.

Mental models allow a person to predict the results of his actions. They include only enough information to allow accurate predictions.
