I decide to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for speed, simplicity, security profile and quality free hosting (Github).

It occurred to me, while assessing options for [ianteda.com](ianteda.com) any platform ([CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)) worth its salt would use a cache system. And a cache system turns a dynamic site into a static site. The main reason I would want a CMS would be for others authors to add content, which I don't need since [ianteda.com](ianteda.com) is all about me. Lets skip the whole CMS and go straight to the static Website. Enter [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

#### Jekyll
Question: What is Jekyll? Answer: Well, it is a Website generator.

Jekyll calls it self:
> [A] simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

#### Speed
No database means speed
To get speed any dynamic Website builds a cache of static files, removing the need for database calls.

#### Simplicity
No database calls
Control of the system
Predicable, the static files are what you get means peace of mind

#### Security
Moving parts
No database calls
No login to CMS

#### Free hosting
Static means no database, which means cheep hosting
