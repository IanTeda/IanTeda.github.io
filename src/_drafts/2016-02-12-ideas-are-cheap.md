### Promise

Ideas are easy, cheap even. It is the execution that is hard, and because it is hard it's worth millions. Otherwise everyone would be doing.

Ideas are easy. Even if you have a awesome unique idea, it want be long before someone else is copying it. After all it is a awesome idea. Success there for comes down to execution. How you take that idea, brand it, market it and sell it. Sales people have a bad reputation as being manipulative and pushy. Lierers, but if you believe in what you are selling and are up front about the competition then you aren't manipulating you are selling something you believe in, something that will be benifical. If you don't believe in yourself there is a problem.
