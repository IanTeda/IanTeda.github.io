Ideas are easy, cheap even. It is the execution that is hard, and because it is hard it is worth millions. If it wasn't difficult everyone would be doing it, and if everyone was doing it it wouldn't be worth as much.

It is important to realise that an idea is not a product, it is not a business. A business, is an idea that is -- or multiple ideas that are -- executed well.  But ideas still have a value. An idea is multiplied by its execution to produce value for the business.  A good idea is worth more than a bad idea when multiplied by good execution.

~~~~~~~~
// Value Proposition
Product Value = Idea x Execution

// Bad Idea Multiplier
Product Value = 1 x 100,000 = 100,000 Units

// Good Idea Multiplier
Product Value = 100 x 100,000 = 10,000,000 Units

// Awful Idea Multiplier
Product Value = -1 x 100,000 = - 100,000 Units
~~~~~~~~

The more value or better an idea, the more it will multiple the value of the product.

Even if you have an original, totally awesome idea, it want be long before someone else is copying it. After all it is an awesome idea. Success, therefor is about execution. The way you take that idea, brand it, market it, position it and then sell it.

You don't need an original idea. Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social platform and the iPod wasn't the first music player. They just executed the idea better the those that came before and after them.

What makes a bad idea? It's hard to say. A bad idea maybe disguising itself as a good idea executed poorly. All the time you are thinking to yourself "I just need to persist and execute better", when all you are doing is burning energy on an idea that you pushing up hill. It is important therefor to validate ideas (a topic for another post) before you execute.

So don't burn energy protecting and worrying that someone will steal your idea, they will. Put your focus into idea generation, idea valuation but mostly idea execution.
