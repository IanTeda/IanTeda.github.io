> All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it's impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.
> <cite>-- Chapter III: Of Mixed Princedoms</cite>

There is risk with all things in life. It cannot be avoided so do not let the possibility of failure prevent action. An indecision is still a decision. Move forward knowing that the decision you made was the right one, based on the knowledge you had at the time. Whether or not it turns out to be right is besides the point, considered action is.

Becoming successful requires risk and with risk comes mistakes. It is through these mistakes that we learn and grow. We can try and avoid risk but in the end we will make mistakes. However, there are mistakes of sloth (mistakes) and mistakes of ambition. Mistake of sloth lead to missed opportunity and regret. While, for the most part mistakes of ambition will be forgiven because they come from good intentions. Mistakes of sloth are not so easily forgiven and often it is ourselves that are the last to forget, because of our regret.

Success for the most part is subjective, but what ever your measure may be it still requires action. It is comfortable to stay on the path of least resistance, because it is well walked. But be bold and walk the road less traveled.
