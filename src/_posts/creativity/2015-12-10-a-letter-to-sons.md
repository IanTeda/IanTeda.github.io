Live, love, be generous, show respect and give thanks.

Know who you are and remember were you came from, but always look forward to were you are going.

Time is the most valuable thing you have, as death comes to us all. So spend your time wisely and without regrets. Make peace with God, yourself, your family and your friends so that when the day comes for you to face the great divide, you face it without the fear of death in your heart and without regrets. That your journey across will be one of ease and satisfaction of a life lived with only mistakes.

Show respect to others and demand they respect you. Abuse no one and nothing because abuse turns the wise to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.

Give thanks for what you have and for the joy of life. If you see no reason to give thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.
