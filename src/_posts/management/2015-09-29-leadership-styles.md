The father of leadership is arguably the psychologist [Kurt Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin), who in 1939 proposed that there are 3 styles of leadership[^enotes]:

1 The Authoritarian (Autocratic)
2 The Participator (Democratic)
3 The Delegator (Laissez-faire)

The Authoritarian leader who rules by ones self: She provides clear expectations on what needs to be done, when it should be completed and how to complete it. They provide vision and direction, then try to convince people to follow. With a clear division between the leader and the workers.

The Participator leader runs things by majority rules: She encourages group members to participate, offers guidance but retains final say over the decision making. They spend time building consensus amongst the group, the use that consensus to drive the direction. 

The Delegator leader allows a high level of autonomy: She offers little to no guidance to the group and leaves decision making up the group members. They spend time building up the individuals around them to make there own decisions.

Kurt Lewin studied the three styles of leadership[^definition-of-leadership] and discovered that members of an Authoritarian leadership are the most productive. While members of Participator leaders maybe less productive, they produce higher quality work. With members of a delegator leader often lack motivation and have poorly defined roles.

Like most things in life it is important to be balanced. To be a mixture of all three styles. Be able to use each style when ablicable, but not living at the extreme.

I think my personal style is part authoritarian and part participator. Properly more authoritarian then participator but I think that is a result of my drive from being goal and outcome driven. Though I also recognise the need to be a participator and get people involved and owning what they are doing. I lean away from the delegator style mainly due to the fact I believe it is important for a leader to have the answers.

In the name of balance and yin yang a good leader most be able apply all three styles and be able to identify when it is appropriate to use which style. They must be able to use the authoritative style when the group lacks knowledge, use the participative style when the group clearly understands their objectives and there roles in the task and use the delegative style when the members know more about the task at hand then they do. Participative leadership is said to be the most effective style of leadership though I think it can easily become a delegator style, the least effective, if the leader does not retain the final say over the decision making.
