If you are not branding yourself, you can be sure others are doing it for you. Going to a job interview, leasing a house or going on a first date then your name will be googled. Personal branding is about managing your name in a world of misinformation, disinformation, and semi-permanent Google records. “We are CEOs of our own companies: Me Inc.”, Tom Peters in Fast Company.

Personal branding is about telling your story, letting the world know what you stand for and building credibility (trust) around it. As Chris Ducker says, think of your personal brand as what people say about you when you leave the room.

### Your Story

> If people like you they will listen to you, but if they trust you, they’ll do business with you.
> <cite> — Zig Ziglar</cite>

Your story is the proof, the walk behind your talk. It is a demonstration of who you are and what you believe in. Don’t create for yourself two worlds, be authentic. People will see through your false world, discard what you say and never follow you.

### Your Values

> If people believe they share values with a company, they will stay loyal to the brand.
> <cite> — Howard Schultz</cite>

People buy the brand not the product. In the same way, people will buy into you not what you are saying. [^youtube-apple-values]. What code to you live by? The best test of your character is what you do when nobody else is watching.

### Build Credibility

> A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.
> <cite> — Seth Godin</cite>

Building credibility is about continuing your story, sharing your thoughts and putting yourself out there to be challenged. It builds your personal trust, authenticity and authority. The best way to accomplish this is to blog, write down what you believe, think or see and put a URL to it.
