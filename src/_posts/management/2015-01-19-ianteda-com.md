Hello and thank you for visiting [ianteda.com](ianteda.com), my little corner of the internet. This Website was born out of a few ideas and insights:

* A desire to be useful [Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/130338537981/the-moist-robot-ethical-code)
* Improve my writing (create content)
* Explore ideas
* Marketing and branding my own image
* If you have an idea or work something out then put a URL to it [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx)

This Website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) task runner.
