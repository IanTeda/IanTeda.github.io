You need to find your own style of leadership, one that complements your character. However, you still need know how to use and when the dynamics require a particular style.

The father of leadership is arguably the psychologist [Kurt Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin), who in 1939 proposed there are 3 styles of leadership[^enotes]:

1. The Authoritarian (Autocratic) Leader
2. The Participator (Democratic) Leader
3. The Delegator (Laissez-faire) Leader

The Authoritarian rules by ones self. She provides clear expectations on output, when it needs to be completed and how to complete it. She creates vision and direction, then convinces people to follow. Autocratic styles result in a clear division between leaders and works.

The Participator is all about majority rule. She encourages group members to participate, offers guidance but retains final say over the decision making. She spends time building consensus amongst the group and with that she drives the direction.

The Delegator allows a high level of autonomy. She offers little to no guidance to the group and leaves decision making to the members. She spends time building up individuals to make there own decisions.

Kurt Lewin studied the three styles of leadership[^definition-of-leadership] and discovered that members of Authoritarian leadership are the most productive. Members of Participator leadership, while being less productive produce better quality work. While members of Delegator leadership often lacking motivation and have poorly defined roles.

Like most things in life, it isn't healthy to live at the extreme. You need to have balance. I belive it is also true for leadership styles. Living at the extreme of one styles isn't productive for you or the group. Your default style should be somewhere in the intersection of the three. However, you need to be able to goto one of the extremes if the dynamics require it.

The Autocratic style is when the group -- or individual -- lacks knowledge, use the Participator style when the group clearly understands their objectives and there roles in the task and use the delegative style when the members know more about the task at hand then they do. Participative leadership is said to be the most effective style of leadership though I think it can easily become a delegator style, the least effective, if the leader does not retain the final say over the decision making.
