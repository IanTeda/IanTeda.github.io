### About
*The story so far*

I enjoy a good adventure. Always curious about what is around the next bend. My most rewarding adventure at the moment is raising two young boys -- Austin and Dillan, that I share with my beautiful wife Laura.

I have been fortunate to work as a Civil Engineer on some amazing projects within NSW and ACT Australia. Some highlights I am proud to say I worked on include: balanced cantilever segmental bridges; a dry well intake tower as part of a new RCC dam; bulk earthworks on Pacific Highway upgrade; and the manufacture of precast bridge elements such as pile caps and Super T beams. My hard work comes with the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of my labours at the end of the day as the project develops and is born into existence.

### Code

*What I am trying to live by*

> I choose to be authentic through honesty, integrity and transparency. With a spirit for creativity, imagination and adventure. Seeking personal growth by being curious, learning and reflecting. Looking for freedom through the discipline of habit. Most of all I am trying to be useful by adding value in what I do.
