&lt;p&gt;Hello and thank you for visiting &lt;a href=&quot;ianteda.com&quot;&gt;ianteda.com&lt;/a&gt;, my little corner of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created &lt;a href=&quot;ianteda.com&quot;&gt;ianteda.com&lt;/a&gt; with the desire to be useful by providing content around ideas, thoughts and projects I am learning and working on. Second to being useful, I wanted to build and manage my professional image, brand and authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of being useful came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dilbert.com/post/130338537981/the-moist-robot-ethical-code&quot;&gt;Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt; the creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbert.com&quot;&gt;Dilbert Cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. The answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt; but “Be Useful”. Need a business idea? How can you be useful. What should I do in life? Be useful. How can I get people to like me? Be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I be useful? By providing content around ideas, thoughts and projects, putting a URL to it ( thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx&quot;&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt;) and sharing. It comes with the added bonuses of helping build a brand, authority, practice my writing and help develop ideas through the articulation of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
