&lt;p&gt;It is easy to focus on your work and for your work to become your world. But it is equally important to keep the bigger picture in mind and maintain perspective. To learn the context of where your work fits into the bigger machine, what external forces could effect your work and how you might be able to help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, take the long slow way around site. Keeping one eye open, observing what others are doing. And your ear to the ground, listening to what others are saying in meetings and in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this you are able to answer more questions, know the right person to ask your question and where to find that stock N16 bar when you under order.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The 6 Ps: Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - U.S. Army&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect the 6 Ps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prevents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Piss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---prior&quot;&gt;1 - Prior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Abraham Lincoln&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave your planning to the last moment. Insteed, dive into the detail early to make sure a lack of planning doesn’t become somebody else’s priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---planning&quot;&gt;2 - Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A goal without a plan is just a wish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictures! There is a reason why we build of drawings. And planning should be no different. Make drawings, sketches and slides to convey your message, the mental picture of how it is going to be built. Your vision if you would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3---prevents&quot;&gt;3 - Prevents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A plan that everyone dislikes for different reasons is a success. A plan everyone dislikes for the same reason is a failure. And a plan that everyone likes for the same reason is an act of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure understanding of your vision by asking for feedback. And be humble enough to accept criticsm and adapt your plan as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4---piss&quot;&gt;4 - Piss&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of failures: those who thought and never did, and those who did and never thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consult grey haired people. This isn’t the first time, so learn from other peoples mistakes and avoid mistakes of the past. Search out common school boy errors and plan around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---poor&quot;&gt;5 - Poor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who fail to plan, plans to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never really learn something until you have to teach it. So the best way to understand howto build something is to try and explain it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6---performance&quot;&gt;6 - Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poor planning or poor execution of plans is simply to let some force other than reason shape reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Robert McNamara&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The early bird catches the worm.
&lt;cite&gt; - William Camden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always try to start work early because it demonstrates that you want your job and you want to be there. Most things can be taught, enthusiasim and desire, for the most part, cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to work early gives you the oppurtunity to set the destiny of construction for the day. Otherwise you will be chasing your tail all day, trying to get construction moving in the direction you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last reason is about respect. Don’t ask people to do things you wouldn’t do yourself. Your formen and workers are starting early, so should you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fruits of one’s labor(s): the results of one’s work. We displayed the fruits of our labor at the county fair. What have you accomplished? Where is the fruit of your labors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction work demands a lot of hours from you. Early mornings, late evenings, weekends and night shifts. But with those hours comes the satisfaction of seeing things get built. Creating something from nothing. Giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, little by little the project gets built. Untill finally it is born and you get to say “I had a part in building that”. That this town has better water, sewer, safer roads, better infrastructure because of the hours I put in. That during the hard times, and all projects have them, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. An end and it is something you can tell your kids about.

&lt;cite&gt;Jim Rohn&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From construction of the project to your career, success — however you measure it — is largely a result of the people around you. So make an effort to build relationships with everyone, from the project director to the members of the workforce. And the best way to build relationships is to say hello and make an effort to learn peoples name. But always be authentic in your relationships, because people will quickly see through you when your aim is to get something out of them. Your aim in any relationship should be about what you can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does matter who you know, as it is often through the 2nd and 3rd levels of relationships that you find work opportunities, get promoted, grow outside your prejudices — you will always find people to reinforce your views when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Birds%20of%20a%20feather%20flock%20together&quot;&gt;birds of a feather flock together&lt;/a&gt; — or even meet your significant other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to make everyone happy, don’t be a leader - seal ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Be in control of your destiny, by getting out in front of issues and avoiding suprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, I want to know about the good news and the bad news. But don’t bring me surprises. Surprises indicate a lack of understanding and ownership of what you are responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule is no better illustrated then in cost forecasting. If your quantities, rates and costs continually move around. And this comes as a surprise to you, then it is a good indicator that you are not in control of your work. And keep in mind that a surprise $1 million profit, 1 month out from closing a project is still a surprise. Was it by luck or good management that you made money? Were you in control? Should we trust you with more money? You should plan for the unknown unknowns, but be transparent about any contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go wrong, everyone understands that. But there is a difference between bad news and surprises. Bad news is owning your mistakes, owning the unknowns and having a plan to mitigate any loses. Having a plan to stop the bleeding. Telling someone bad news and this is the plan, is a whole lot better then surprise we are losing money and I have no idea how much or how to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When bringing bad news about the costs, have an understanding why your quaities increased or why the rate changed. Know what the worst case is if thins are kept the sameπ – understanding the problem – and these are the changes we are making to bring the cost blow out back in – getting in front of the issue and controlling your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me good news, give me bad news. Just don’t give me surprises. No one likes surprises. Make your mistakes ones of ambition, not sloth – &lt;a href=&quot;https://ianteda.com/creativity/the-bold-mistake-instruction.html&quot;&gt;The Bold Mistake Instruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with what seem like mutually exclusive and opposing views, often the answer is both. Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different. The skill comes in first realizing this, being comfortable with the contradictions and knowing how to find the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 2, is a little bit of an abstract concept. But it is important as it adds context and framing to a lot of the other rules – I.e. a rule may be highlighting an extreme, but they doesn’t mean you should live there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safest way to build something is not to build it at all. But that doesn’t get things built. The answer is you need to do both. It needs to be built and it needs to be built safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I micro manage or macro manage? The answer is you should do both. There are times when you need to focus in on the detail to make sure things run smoothly, but you will get to a level of micro where the return on your time does not warrant the focus and you need to execute and step back into the macro so you can first see where you need adjust and then make the adjustment. The return is in the execution, but if you don’t but enough time into the detail the execution will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I be good cop or bad cop? The answer is both. You must be able to go to the extremes of being angry and being passive, and be able to recognise when and how to deploy each of them. But you cannot live life at the extreme of either. You need to be able to defend your ideas, but if you never change your mind people will not approach you with what could be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Rule 1 - Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to ask graduate engineers when they are starting in construction “What do think your job is?”, because it helps to orientate there thinking. It is also true for people starting in any career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your job? Your job as a construction engineer is to make money for your employer, XYZ Constructions. You are not there for practice and you are not working for XYZ Construction Charities. XYZ Constructions is paying you a salary of $X with the intention that you return $(X+1). They are looking for a return on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that reality understood, it is important to highlight that the best way to make money in construction is by building it safely, building it once (quality) and leaving a positive legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have two identical projects and on one project someone gets hurt, they have to build it twice and they allow pollution into a local river. Which project will make more money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully appreciating the personal impact to those involved in a safety incident and the negative legacy it leaves behind, if you are worried about meeting program and budget then the last thing you need is a safety incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you consider your project budget has a 10% profit built in and work gets affected for one week, then the project will need to perform at optimum efficiency for the next 100 weeks just to get out of the red and into budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to do the job safely and avoid any loss time injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting corners is a short term game, you may win once or twice but in the end probability always wins and you will have on your hands rework. So keep in mind and respect the five P’s: Prior Planning Prevents Pour Performance. By planning the works, communicating the plan, monitor performance of the plan and adapting the plan where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to do the job once and do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy is about leaving things better than the way you found them. And the legacy you leave behind is your reputation, your promise and your promise is your brand. If your clients do not trust your brand then you will soon have no work on the books. While it is important to live in the present, don’t loose focus of the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving behind a negative legacy for those that work for you, the clients that pay the bills and the community that will use what you build – which is often the case with construction projects – you will soon discover that: no one will want to work for you and you are only as good as the people that work for you; clients will not engage you and without clients there will be no money coming in; and your project will be known as the one. The one that polluted, the one that churned through employees, or the one that is going to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to leave behind a positive legacy. It is through that legacy that you add value. And if your client sees the value they will be happy to have you build something else (for the right price).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ian Teda</name><email>ian@teda.id.au</email></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="construction" /><summary type="html">Rule 1 - Your job is to make money.

  &lt;p&gt;Your beliefs become your thoughts; Your thoughts become your words; Your words become your actions; Your actions become your habits; Your habits become your values; Your values become your destiny.
&lt;cite&gt; Mahatma Ghandi.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our habits that influence our actions, and it is our actions that define our character. It is what we do, our habits, not what we say that people judge use on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good habits are hard to form, and take continuous effort to maintain. While bad habits sneak up on us by surprise, forming easily and fast. And once created habits are hard to remove, because they become hard wired into our brains by cravings. These cravings – addictions – for the reward drive the routine. Habits are like a folded piece of paper that always wants to return to the fold it knows. Habits can be your making or your undoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explored what habits are and how they work in a previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ianteda.com/creativity/the-habit-loop.html&quot;&gt;The Habit Loop&lt;/a&gt;. Pause here and give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-habits&quot;&gt;Creating Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Men’s natures are alike; it is their habits that separate them.
&lt;cite&gt; Confucius, Analects.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/habit-loop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Habit Loop&quot; title=&quot;The Habit Loop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most habits sneak up on use by surprise, because we are not aware of the cues and rewards. But habits can be intentionally formed by putting together a cue, routine, and reward. To form a new habit spend time cultivating the craving for the reward that the routine provides. This in turn will drive the habit loop and hard wire in the craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However for must of us, we already have a lifetime of habits. And these existing cues and rewards will be in direct competition with the new habits we want to form. So it is not new habits that we should concentrate on, but the modification of old ones. And this requires a different approach, an indirect one. One where we use the existing hard wired craving, but insert a new routine or habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-habits&quot;&gt;Changing Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our habits have occurred for so long that we pay little attention to them. Often not recognizing the habit loop as it forms. It seems simple, but once you understand how habits works and can recognize the cues and rewards. You are halfway to changing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-habit-modification-framework&quot;&gt;The Habit Modification Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.com/081298160X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/book-power-of-habit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business Book Cover&quot; title=&quot;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business&quot; class=&quot;book-cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.com/081298160X&quot;&gt;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business&lt;/a&gt;” Charles Duhigg proposes a framework&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:framework&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:framework&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for changing habits. I have modified it slightly into the framework below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isolate the Cue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment with Rewards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Modification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insert a Routine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a plan (You Only have so Much Will Power)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-awareness&quot;&gt;Step 1: Awareness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most habits sneak up on use by surprise, operating in the background while we live in the future. So the first step is to increase our awareness around the habit we want to change. To better understand who we are and why we behave the way we do, start by isolating the cue and then experimenting with rewards. Through this we build up our awareness and understanding of self and why we behave the way we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate the cue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cues fit into one of five categories: time; location; emotional state; other people; or immediately preceding an action or event. To help identify the specific cue that initiates the habit, ask yourself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What time is it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where am I?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What emotion am I feeling?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who else is around?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did I just do or happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep a log of the answers to each of these questions, even if it feels meaningless. There is a lot information bombarding us as our behaviors unfold, making it hard to isolate the cue. By keeping a log it forces momentary awareness, letting you reflect on the present and what just happened. Look for patterns within your answers, because the cue is within the answer to one of the five questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the reward your habit provides and is craving is not what you think it is. The best way to identify the reward you are graving is by substituting rewards. When you observer the habit cue, substitute a reward. Is the graving gone? No! Then substitute the opposite reward. Is the graving gone? Yes! Awesome, that is what you are graving. By experimenting with different rewards, you can narrow down what you are actually craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? or is it the reward of taking a break before starting another task?  Is it the cookie itself? The change of scenery? The temporary distraction? or perhaps it is the socializing with colleagues? It might appear that the reward is the chocolate bar, but its not. It is getting up from your desk to take a break or socialise around the water bubbler that is the reward and what you are craving at 3pm in the afternoon. And going to get a chocolate bar is a way of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you test four or five different rewards, look for patterns. After each activity, log the first three things that come to mind when you get back to your desk. Test different hypotheses through substatution to determine which craving is driving your routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stage-2-modification&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Modification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have developed a good awareness of the cue and reward of the habit you want to change, the next step is to change the routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert a Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routine or behavior is usually the most obvious part of the habit, because it is the behaviour we would like to change. A good approach is to insert an opposing behavior, one that can be done for longer than a couple of minutes and is unnoticeable to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the chocolate bar example. Recognising it is the break from your work that you are graving, get up and go for a walk around the block. Is it the socialising, get up and go for a walk around the block with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness, understanding and desire isn’t enough. The will power that drives your desire for change is like a muscle. It has limited strength and endurance. But like a muscle your will power can be trained, practiced, and increased. Will power is a skill, a skill you can learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have a limit supply of will power, it is important to develop a plan, a strategy to help limit your need for willpower, increase your will power and coping mechanisms when the will power tank gets low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;100 percent&lt;/em&gt;: it is easier to say no 100% of the time then 99% of the time. Just this once, will start the old habit back up again. Be conscious of your cues and rewards and keep with the routine substitution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change it up&lt;/em&gt;: temptation is hard to resists, so if possible remove the craving by removing the cue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The donut&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jockopodcast2.com/&quot;&gt;Jocko Willink&lt;/a&gt; offers a good mental trick to increase your mental toughness, will power. When you observe the cue, say to yourself “me will power is greater than that of the donut”. Meaning if you eat the donut, you are saying that the donut an inanimate object is stronger than you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internalise&lt;/em&gt;: don’t make your goal finite, make it systems orientated. Your goal shouldn’t be to drop X kilograms, but to learn systems, processes and behaviours that will allow your body to lose weight. So even if you don’t drop X kilograms within Y months you have achieved your goal of learning more about what works for you and how you body works.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keystone&lt;/em&gt;: build habits of other habits. Break things down to small wins. Want to exercise more, work on the habit of getting up early. Then build on that by exercising first thing in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep a log&lt;/em&gt;: writing down a few words helps later when recalling what you were thinking, feeling or doing. Our brains don’t remember the whole story. They remember key events and build out the rest with our understanding of reality. That is why a smell or a place can bring up memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Watch your thoughts, they become your WORDS. Watch your words, they become you ACTIONS. Watch your actions, they become your HABITS. Watch your habits, they become your CHARACTER. Watch your character, it becomes your DESTINY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A habit is something you can do without thinking — which is why most of us have so many of them.
&lt;cite&gt; Frank A. Clark.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are, for the most part a collection of habits. A collection of emotional, physical and intellectual habits, systematically organised for our brains optimisation. Manifesting themselves in our character, businesses, social groups and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might appear that the choices we make each day are the product of a well thought out conscious decision, but they are not. They are habits. On its own a habit doesn’t seem like much, but as a collective they shape the way we behave and ultimately our character. “You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.” – C.G. Jung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits allow us to undertake tasks with difficulty the first time, but then over time with increasing ease and final in a semi-autonomous mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Duhigg in his book “The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business” breaks habits down into a three-step loop, the habit loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cue: first a trigger, that tells our brain to go into automatic mode and to use routine 1423;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Routine: Now in autonomous mode, the brain steps through the pre defined 1243 routine – which can be emotional, physical or intellectual;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reward: finally, a reward reinforces the routine. Helping the brain figure out if the particular routine – loop – is worth remembering;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits emerge without permission because our brains are constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often and conserve mental energy. Any behaviour that can be reduced to a routine is one less behaviour that we must spend time and energy consciously thinking about and deciding upon. Habits free up time and energy for other matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are habits so powerful? It is because they create neurological cravings. Over time, the habit loop - cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward - becomes more and more automatic. The cue ends up being so bound up with the reward that the cue itself will trigger a craving for the reward: “the cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerge” – Charles Duhigg . Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their influence. But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subconscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits could be brought about by a craving for positive emotions, or accomplishment or relationships.  Almost all habit cues fall into one of five categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emotional state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The immediately preceding action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example every McDonald’s looks the same - the company deliberately tries to standardize stores’ architecture and what employees say to customers, so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines. The sound a Coca-Cola can makes when you open it. The foaming of your tooth paste. Why you always enter a Supermarket on the left hand side and the fresh food is first.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The chains of habit are generally too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.

Frank A. Clark. We are, for the most part a collection of habits. A collection of emotional, physical and intellectual habits, systematically organised for our brains optimisation. Manifesting themselves in our character, businesses, social groups and cultures. It might appear that the choices we make each day are the product of a well thought out conscious decision, but they are not. They are habits. On its own a habit doesn’t seem like much, but as a collective they shape the way we behave and ultimately our character. “You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.” – C.G. Jung. Habits allow us to undertake tasks with difficulty the first time, but then over time with increasing ease and final in a semi-autonomous mode. Charles Duhigg in his book “The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business” breaks habits down into a three-step loop, the habit loop: Cue: first a trigger, that tells our brain to go into automatic mode and to use routine 1423; Routine: Now in autonomous mode, the brain steps through the pre defined 1243 routine – which can be emotional, physical or intellectual; Reward: finally, a reward reinforces the routine. Helping the brain figure out if the particular routine – loop – is worth remembering; Habits emerge without permission because our brains are constantly looking for ways to save effort.
