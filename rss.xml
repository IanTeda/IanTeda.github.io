  &lt;p&gt;You don’t know, what you don’t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Unknown&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never have truer words been spoken. It is always the unknown unknowns that get you. Because they blind side you when you are looking the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What gets measured gets managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Peter Drucker&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want people to focus on something, ask them to measure it. And pop quiz them each day about what the number is. The pop quiz will help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force them to understand what is going on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:rule3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:rule3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give you a level of confidence they have the situation under control. If from day to day they know how the number has changed and why;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinforce that this is important to you;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow you adapt sooner to changes. With the level of detail or how often you measure being relative to the complexity and size;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Measurement is fabulous. Unless you are busy measuring what is easy to measure as opposed to what’s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;  - Seth Godin&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worried about not meeting program: measure how many m3 of concrete have gone in, tonnes of reinforcement or dollars spent to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worried about the budget: measure man hours, plant hours or wastage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One accurate measurement, is worth a thousand expert opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Unknown&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best tool I have found for measuring on construction projects is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management&quot;&gt;Earn Value Analysis (EVA)&lt;/a&gt;. It allows you to measure scope, time and costs against planned work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Jimmy Dean&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always start with the end in mind. What is the ideal outcome? What is your destination? And then breakdown the journey into manageable pieces, reverse engineering the path to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a destination, you don’t have direction. And if you don’t have direction you are lost, going around and around in circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By prevailing over all obstacles and distractions, one may unfailingly arrive at his chosen goal or destination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Christopher Columbus&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path isn’t always clear, because the path is not always well traveled. But with an end in mind, a good internal compass and a belief in self you can reach your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good internal compass is about optimism. The optimism that the destination is achievable, even when the path isn’t clear. But a good internal compass is not just about optimism, it is also about having enough self awareness to know when a correction is needed. To know when you have strayed off course and need to get back on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path less traveled can be dangerous, it is uncharted and filled with traps. And when pioneering, when innovating often you will need to be the first to taste the berries and hope they are not poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To become ‘unique,’ the challenge is to fight the hardest battle which anyone can imagine until you reach your destination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– A. P. J. Abdul Kalam&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The 6 Ps: Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - U.S. Army&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect the 6 Ps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prevents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Piss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---prior&quot;&gt;1 - Prior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Abraham Lincoln&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave your planning to the last moment. Insteed, dive into the detail early to make sure a lack of planning doesn’t become somebody else’s priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---planning&quot;&gt;2 - Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A goal without a plan is just a wish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictures! There is a reason why we build of drawings. And planning should be no different. Make drawings, sketches and slides to convey your message, the mental picture of how it is going to be built. Your vision if you would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3---prevents&quot;&gt;3 - Prevents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A plan that everyone dislikes for different reasons is a success. A plan everyone dislikes for the same reason is a failure. And a plan that everyone likes for the same reason is an act of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure understanding of your vision by asking for feedback. And be humble enough to accept criticsm and adapt your plan as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4---piss&quot;&gt;4 - Piss&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of failures: those who thought and never did, and those who did and never thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consult grey haired people. This isn’t the first time, so learn from other peoples mistakes and avoid mistakes of the past. Search out common school boy errors and plan around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---poor&quot;&gt;5 - Poor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who fail to plan, plans to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never really learn something until you have to teach it. So the best way to understand howto build something is to try and explain it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6---performance&quot;&gt;6 - Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poor planning or poor execution of plans is simply to let some force other than reason shape reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Robert McNamara&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can spend your time putting out fires, or you can spent your time planning and adapting. If you spend all your time putting out fires, then for the most part your destiny is being set by other forces outside your control.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The early bird catches the worm.
&lt;cite&gt; - William Camden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always try to start work early because it demonstrates that you want your job and you want to be there. Most things can be taught, enthusiasim and desire, for the most part, cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to work early gives you the oppurtunity to set the destiny of construction for the day. Otherwise you will be chasing your tail all day, trying to get construction moving in the direction you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last reason is about respect. Don’t ask people to do things you wouldn’t do yourself. Your formen and workers are starting early, so should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction work demands a lot of hours from you. Early mornings, late evenings, weekends and night shifts. But with those hours comes the satisfaction of seeing things get built. Creating something from nothing. Giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, little by little the project gets built. Untill finally it is born and you get to say “I had a part in building that”. That this town has better water, sewer, safer roads, better infrastructure because of the hours I put in.

  &lt;p&gt;You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.
&lt;cite&gt;Jim Rohn&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From construction of the project to your career, success — however you measure it — is largely a result of the people around you. So make an effort to build relationships with everyone, from the project director to the members of the workforce. And the best way to build relationships is to say hello and make an effort to learn peoples name. But always be authentic in your relationships, because people will quickly see through you when your aim is to get something out of them. Your aim in any relationship should be about what you can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does matter who you know, as it is often through the 2nd and 3rd levels of relationships that you find work opportunities, get promoted, grow outside your prejudices — you will always find people to reinforce your views when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Birds%20of%20a%20feather%20flock%20together&quot;&gt;birds of a feather flock together&lt;/a&gt; — or even meet your significant other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

That often you will need to say no, making people upset. The easy answer is “Yes”, but don’t let yourself be pressured into a yes or avoid a hard truth because you don’t want to upset someone.&lt;/p&gt;

Jim Rohn From construction of the project to your career, success — however you measure it — is largely a result of the people around you. So make an effort to build relationships with everyone, from the project director to the members of the workforce. And the best way to build relationships is to say hello and make an effort to learn peoples name. But always be authentic in your relationships, because people will quickly see through you when your aim is to get something out of them. Your aim in any relationship should be about what you can do for them. It does matter who you know, as it is often through the 2nd and 3rd levels of relationships that you find work opportunities, get promoted, grow outside your prejudices — you will always find people to reinforce your views when birds of a feather flock together — or even meet your significant other. If you want to make everyone happy, don’t be a leader - seal ice cream. The rule 2 here — the flip side, the other side of the coin — is that it isn’t a popularity contest and that you are not there to make friends.

  &lt;p&gt;Be in control of your destiny, by getting out in front of issues and avoiding suprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, I want to know about the good news and the bad news. But don’t bring me surprises. Surprises indicate a lack of understanding and ownership of what you are responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule is no better illustrated then in cost forecasting. If your quantities, rates and costs continually move around. And this comes as a surprise to you, then it is a good indicator that you are not in control of your work. And keep in mind that a surprise $1 million profit, 1 month out from closing a project is still a surprise. Was it by luck or good management that you made money? Were you in control? Should we trust you with more money? You should plan for the unknown unknowns, but be transparent about any contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go wrong, everyone understands that. But there is a difference between bad news and surprises. Bad news is owning your mistakes, owning the unknowns and having a plan to mitigate any loses. Having a plan to stop the bleeding. Telling someone bad news and this is the plan, is a whole lot better then surprise we are losing money and I have no idea how much or how to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When bringing bad news about the costs, have an understanding why your quaities increased or why the rate changed. Know what the worst case is if thins are kept the sameπ – understanding the problem – and these are the changes we are making to bring the cost blow out back in – getting in front of the issue and controlling your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me good news, give me bad news. Just don’t give me surprises. No one likes surprises. Make your mistakes ones of ambition, not sloth – &lt;a href=&quot;https://ianteda.com/creativity/the-bold-mistake-instruction.html&quot;&gt;The Bold Mistake Instruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with what seem like mutually exclusive and opposing views, often the answer is both. Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different. The skill comes in first realizing this, being comfortable with the contradictions and knowing how to find the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 2, is a little bit of an abstract concept. But it is important as it adds context and framing to a lot of the other rules – I.e. a rule may be highlighting an extreme, but they doesn’t mean you should live there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safest way to build something is not to build it at all. But that doesn’t get things built. The answer is you need to do both. It needs to be built and it needs to be built safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I micro manage or macro manage? The answer is you should do both. There are times when you need to focus in on the detail to make sure things run smoothly, but you will get to a level of micro where the return on your time does not warrant the focus and you need to execute and step back into the macro so you can first see where you need adjust and then make the adjustment. The return is in the execution, but if you don’t but enough time into the detail the execution will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I be good cop or bad cop? The answer is both. You must be able to go to the extremes of being angry and being passive, and be able to recognise when and how to deploy each of them. But you cannot live life at the extreme of either. You need to be able to defend your ideas, but if you never change your mind people will not approach you with what could be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Rule 1 - Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do think your job is?”. It is a question I like to ask graduate engineers as they are starting in construction, because it helps to orientate them as they start life in the workforce and start in construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your job? Your job as a construction engineer is to make money for your employer, XYZ Constructions. You are not there for practice and you are not working for XYZ Construction Charities. XYZ Constructions is paying you a salary of $X with the intention that you return $(X+1). They are looking for a return on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that reality understood, it is important to highlight that the best way to make money in construction is by building it safely, building it once (quality) and leaving a positive legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have two identical projects and on one project someone gets hurt, they have to build it twice and they allow pollution into a local river. Which project will make more money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully appreciating the personal impact to those involved in a safety incident and the negative legacy it leaves behind, if you are worried about meeting program and budget then the last thing you need is a safety incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you consider your project budget has a 10% profit built in and work gets affected for one week, then the project will need to perform at optimum efficiency for the next 100 weeks just to get out of the red and into budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to do the job safely and avoid any loss time injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting corners is a short game, you may win once or twice but in the end probability always wins and you will have on your hands rework. So keep in mind and respect &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ianteda.com/engineering/rule-6-the-6-ps.html&quot;&gt;Rule 6 - The Six P’s: Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By planning the works, communicating the plan, monitor performance of the plan and adapting when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to do the job once and do it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy is about what you leave behind. A positive legacy is leaving things better than how you found them. And the legacy you leave behind is your reputation, your promise and your promise is your brand. If your clients do not trust your brand then you will soon have no work on hand. While it is important to live in the present, don’t loose focus of the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving behind a negative legacy for those that work for you, the clients that pay the bills and the community that will use what you build — which is often the case with construction projects — you will soon discover that: no one will want to work for you and you are only as good as the people that work for you; clients will not engage you and without clients there will be no money coming in; and your project will be known as the one. The one that polluted, the one that churned through employees, or the one that is falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to leave behind a positive legacy. It is through that legacy that you add value. And if your client sees the value they will be happy to have you build something else (for the right price).&lt;/p&gt;
