  &lt;p&gt;Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Tony Robbins&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions are the cornerstone of communication – aka leadership, problem solving and learning. So being able to ask good questions is the key to good communication, efficient problem solving and effective learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an art to asking a good questions, because after all if you put garbage in you get garbage out. If people are giving you the wrong answers, the chances are you are asking the wrong questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-ended-questions--communication&quot;&gt;Open-Ended Questions – Communication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is not the answer that enlightens, but the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Decouvertes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open-ended question is question that has a non yes-or-no answer. Open-ended questions invite people into a conversation and make them articulate their point of view, give you their opinions and share their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are particularly useful when approaching safety corners. Instead of asking “Do you think that is safe?”, ask “When you went through your project induction, what did you discuss about ladders?” or “Explain to me what a Job Safety Analysis Card is?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open ended questions can be a little uncomfortable, because they appear to hand control of the conversation to the respondent&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:changeminds&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:changeminds&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is where the art of a good question comes in. Plan your questions, know your end, frame it for the respondent, use neutral words, focus for one answer, don’t interrupt, listen and use there answer to transition to the next question. Building the conversation so that in the end they feel like the idea or make the statement you are leading them towards is theres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you able to explain to me what a Job Safety Analysis Card is?”, “Awesome, what was on your teams JSA card this morning?”, and “Why do you think working from a ladder is dangerous?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When getting to know people and building relationships open-ended questions about them are a great way to build rapport. After all, we all love talking about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-5-whys&quot;&gt;The 5 Why’s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you do not ask the right questions, you do not get the right answers. A question asked in the right way often points to its own answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— Edward Hodnett&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toddlers love to ask why, over and over and over again. And so should you. Often the root cause to a problem can be found in the fifth why&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5whys&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5whys&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Start by defining the problem, then ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why did the problem just happen?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, but why was that?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, but why was that?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, but why was that?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, but why was that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the five why’s, you will be a lot closer to understanding your problem. Asking why sounds simplistic, but it forces people to articulate their view. But ensure answers are based in truth, that it can be demonstrated. With each successive why, a layer of fluff is removed. Simplifying the groups understanding of the problem and its cause. The root cause can be found in the most simplistic explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-you-paraphrase-what-i-just-said&quot;&gt;Can you Paraphrase what I just Said?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For true success ask yourself these four questions: Why? Why not? Why not me? Why not now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— James Allen&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to check-in when explaining something new to people, to help ensure understanding. It can be frustrating when someone walks away and you think they understand what needs to be done. Only to find out a couple of days later that they didn’t understand and missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check-in by asking them to paraphrase – repeat what I just said in there own words – what I have just explained or asked them to do. But keep in mind, if they don’t understand, the chances are you haven’t explained it good enough. So try again and again until they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Question everything. Learn something. Answer nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;— Engineer’s Motto&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything worthwhile is hard. Because it is the difficulties that make it unique and it is the uniqueness that makes it valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Time is the measurer of all things, but is itself immeasurable, and the grand discloser of all things, but is itself undisclosed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Charles Caleb Colton&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to time. After all, money is just the value we place on time. It makes sense then, that the most valuable gift you can give is your time. Because, we don’t know how much we have, we cannot make more of it and once it has turned into yesterday we cannot get it back. When we are young it seems to go on for ever and yet our time maybe up tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you love life, don’t waste time, for time is what life is made up of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Bruce Lee&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time is the most valuable thing we have, then it makes sense to maximise our return. How? Through the routine and discipline of prioritising our demands, executing on our priorities, measuring our output and adapting as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not the master of your time, then time will be the master of you - i.e. you will not have any. Routine is about setting up habits, rituals and behaviours to optimise your time. It is the discipline in these routines that gives you freedom, the freedom to choose what we do with our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Time is free, but its priceless. You can’t own it, but you can use it. You can’t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you’ve lost it, you can never get it back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Harvey Mackay&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in prioritising your time is to apply the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that
80% of your output will typically comes from 20% of your input. With that in mind you need to figure out what your 20% input is and delegate as much of the remainder of your input as possible. Leaving you time to improve the quality of your 80% output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Charles Darwin&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite tool to manage my time (priorities) is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bulletjournal.com/&quot;&gt;bullet journal&lt;/a&gt;. To quote the Bullet Journal website, it is &lt;em&gt;“the analog system for the digital age. The Bullet Journal is a customizable and forgiving organization system. It can be your to-do list, sketchbook, notebook, and diary, but most likely, it will be all of the above. It will teach you to do more with less.”&lt;/em&gt; I would call myself a digital kind of person, but there is something about writing things down and the customisable nature of paper that has won me over. I have been using it for two years now and think it is the best tool for solidifying thoughts, remembering tasks, prioritising demands and tracking output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The strongest of all warriors are these two — Time and Patience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;- Leo Tolstoy&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say that you cannot make a baby with nine women in one month. That sometimes things take, what they take and putting more resources on it will not accelerate time. So you need to deploy a little patience, with some determination thrown in. You can always throw an extra scraper fleet info it, but a D11 can only do so many pushes an hour. Meaning you can physically only fit so many scrapers into the one area and a D11 can only push so many 651s per hour. This is particularly true when it comes to changing groups of people, changing cultural habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; How do you find time?
&lt;em&gt;Answer:&lt;/em&gt; Take control of your time, to find time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force them to understand what is going on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:rule3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:rule3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give you a level of confidence they have the situation under control. If from day to day they know how the number has changed and why;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reinforce that this is important to you;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow you adapt sooner to changes. With the level of detail or how often you measure being relative to the complexity and size;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Jimmy Dean&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always start with the end in mind. What is the ideal outcome? What is your destination? And then breakdown the journey into manageable pieces, reverse engineering the path to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a destination, you don’t have direction. And if you don’t have direction you are lost, going around and around in circles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By prevailing over all obstacles and distractions, one may unfailingly arrive at his chosen goal or destination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt;– Christopher Columbus&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path isn’t always clear, because the path is not always well traveled. But with an end in mind, a good internal compass and a belief in self you can reach your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good internal compass is about optimism. The optimism that the destination is achievable, even when the path isn’t clear. But a good internal compass is not just about optimism, it is also about having enough self awareness to know when a correction is needed. To know when you have strayed off course and need to get back on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path less traveled can be dangerous, it is uncharted and filled with traps. And when pioneering, when innovating often you will need to be the first to taste the berries and hope they are not poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The 6 Ps: Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - U.S. Army&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect the 6 Ps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prevents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Piss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1---prior&quot;&gt;1 - Prior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Abraham Lincoln&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave your planning to the last moment. Insteed, dive into the detail early to make sure a lack of planning doesn’t become somebody else’s priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2---planning&quot;&gt;2 - Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A goal without a plan is just a wish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictures! There is a reason why we build of drawings. And planning should be no different. Make drawings, sketches and slides to convey your message, the mental picture of how it is going to be built. Your vision if you would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3---prevents&quot;&gt;3 - Prevents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A plan that everyone dislikes for different reasons is a success. A plan everyone dislikes for the same reason is a failure. And a plan that everyone likes for the same reason is an act of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure understanding of your vision by asking for feedback. And be humble enough to accept criticsm and adapt your plan as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4---piss&quot;&gt;4 - Piss&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of failures: those who thought and never did, and those who did and never thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consult grey haired people. This isn’t the first time, so learn from other peoples mistakes and avoid mistakes of the past. Search out common school boy errors and plan around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5---poor&quot;&gt;5 - Poor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who fail to plan, plans to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never really learn something until you have to teach it. So the best way to understand howto build something is to try and explain it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6---performance&quot;&gt;6 - Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Poor planning or poor execution of plans is simply to let some force other than reason shape reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;cite&gt; - Robert McNamara&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The early bird catches the worm.
&lt;cite&gt; - William Camden&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always try to start work early because it demonstrates that you want your job and you want to be there. Most things can be taught, enthusiasim and desire, for the most part, cannot be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to work early gives you the oppurtunity to set the destiny of construction for the day. Otherwise you will be chasing your tail all day, trying to get construction moving in the direction you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last reason is about respect. Don’t ask people to do things you wouldn’t do yourself. Your formen and workers are starting early, so should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction work demands a lot of hours from you. Early mornings, late evenings, weekends and night shifts. But with those hours comes the satisfaction of seeing things get built. Creating something from nothing. Giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, little by little the project gets built. Untill finally it is born and you get to say “I had a part in building that”.

&lt;p&gt;From construction of the project to your career, success — however you measure it — is largely a result of the people around you. So make an effort to build relationships with everyone, from the project director to the members of the workforce. And the best way to build relationships is to say hello and make an effort to learn peoples name. But always be authentic in your relationships, because people will quickly see through you when your aim is to get something out of them. Your aim in any relationship should be about what you can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does matter who you know, as it is often through the 2nd and 3rd levels of relationships that you find work opportunities, get promoted, grow outside your prejudices — you will always find people to reinforce your views when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Birds%20of%20a%20feather%20flock%20together&quot;&gt;birds of a feather flock together&lt;/a&gt; — or even meet your significant other.&lt;/p&gt;
