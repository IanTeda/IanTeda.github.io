  &lt;p&gt;Daring ideas are like chessmen moved forward. They may be beaten, but they may start a winning game.
&lt;cite&gt; – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas are easy, cheap even. It is the execution that is hard, and because it is hard it is worth millions. If it wasn’t difficult everyone would be doing it, and if everyone was doing it it wouldn’t be worth as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to realise that an idea is not a product, it is not a business. A business, is an idea that is – or multiple ideas that are – executed well.  But ideas still have a value. An idea is multiplied by its execution to produce value for the business.  A good idea is worth more than a bad idea when multiplied by good execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Value Proposition
Product Value = Idea x Execution

// Bad Idea Multiplier
Product Value = 1 x 100,000 = 100,000 Units

// Good Idea Multiplier
Product Value = 100 x 100,000 = 10,000,000 Units

// Awful Idea Multiplier
Product Value = -1 x 100,000 = - 100,000 Units
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more value or better an idea, the more it will multiple the value of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.
&lt;cite&gt; – Thomas Edison &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have an original, totally awesome idea, it want be long before someone else is copying it. After all it is an awesome idea. Success, therefor is about execution. The way you take that idea, brand it, market it, position it and then sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need an original idea. Google wasn’t the first search engine, Facebook wasn’t the first social platform and the iPod wasn’t the first music player. They just executed the idea better the those that came before and after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a bad idea? It’s hard to say. A bad idea maybe disguising itself as a good idea executed poorly. All the time you are thinking to yourself “I just need to persist and execute better”, when all you are doing is burning energy on an idea that you pushing up hill. It is important therefor to validate ideas (a topic for another post) before you execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t burn energy protecting and worrying that someone will steal your idea, they will. Put your focus into idea generation, idea valuation but mostly idea execution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible intangible force, which may be likened to a third mind [the master mind].
&lt;cite&gt; – Napoleon Hill &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase Mastermind Group (MMG) was first coined by Napoleon Hill in his 1937 book “Think and Grow Rich”. A MMG is not a group coaching session but can be thought of as a peer advisory board that meets with the aim of sharpening the groups personal and business skills so they can achieve optimum outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1585424331&amp;amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=iate-20&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/think-and-grow-rich.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Think and Grow Rich - Book Cover&quot; title=&quot;Think and Grow Rich - Book Cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-why&quot;&gt;The Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” — Jim Rohn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible result of any situation will be the average of all possible outcomes. So if your aim is to become a professional table tennis player, then surround yourself with professional table tennis players. If you want to be successful then surround yourself with and successful people. A MMG is a way of surrounding yourself with like people of similar focuses ambitions and interest, increasing your changes of success. Both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison saw the benefits and were involved in MMGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t reinvent the wheel, you are not the first person to aspire to be a professional table tennis player. MMG help you focus, shape or throw out ideas while increasing your confidence that you’ve made the right decisions and are taking correct actions. While providing inspiration and shared success stories, so you know it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A MMG should be place of unbiased ideas, unbiased respectful opinions, encouragement, inspiration, shared resources and accountability. It should not be about chit chat and gossip but focused on your growth and the growth of others in the group through the collective brain power. To paraphrase Napoleon Hill, success is planned and earned the only limitation you have is the one you accept in your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-in-a-name&quot;&gt;What is in a name?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A name and description helps set the purpose and make clear the groups objective and helps ensure it is formed around people striving for a common purpose, but not necessarily with common perspectives. Hearing different views helps you see the forest from the trees. It is not always easy to see your own problems they way others do. It is important to have people with similar drive, commitment and be in the same place in business/life so that everyone gets something from the MGG and the input doesn’t become lop sided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mmg-membership&quot;&gt;MMG Membership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick your group members carefully, as the group will only be as good as the people in it. Try to choose people with different perspective and skill sets, because they will see the world in a different way and provide solutions you may not see. And only allow new members with the unanimous consent of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to ask a member to leave the group if they are not up to the standard of participation and do it quickly once the poor behaviour becomes evident. A “slacking” member will bring down the energy and fun level of the whole group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-habits-by-creating-rules&quot;&gt;Create habits by creating rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A set of rules will help the group know what is expected of them, avoid disappointment and provide understanding about their return on their investment (time), after all the group needs to work for everyone. If someone is not a good fit for the group (i.e. not meeting expectations), then a set of rules — not followed — makes a hard conversation about someone leaving easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 Rules to create habits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rules are never forever (change where needed).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Group size should stay at 2 to 5 people to provide opportunity for all to speak and be listened to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New members may only come in to the group with unanimous consent after a test in the hot seat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Respect other peoples time. Don’t miss meetings and be on time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happens in the MMG stays in the MMG — it is a sacred place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be willing to dissect and be dissected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meet-regularly-and-precisely&quot;&gt;Meet Regularly and Precisely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep to a regularly scheduled time and ensure all members are punctual and that meetings end on time. Give each member equal time and capture what happens at each meeting: lessons and triumphs; goals; and items you want to keep each other accountable to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming a 60 minute meeting, a meeting will start with a 10 minute round table where everyone shares wins they have had — preferable from there previous meetings goals. This sets a positive tone for the meeting and gets the blood pumping. Followed by a 40 minute hot seat where one member presents a problem or business idea they are working on and the group provides feed back and advice on how to move forward. To close out the meeting a second 10 minute round table where the MMG share goals for the following period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roles-and-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Roles and Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each meeting needs three roles, that are rotated each week: The facilitator,  the hot seat and the group. The each have different responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Facilitator&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person from last weeks hot seat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep track of time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prompt the quiet ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hot Seat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present a problem or issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about current or upcoming projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present a recent finding or discovery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask specific (direction) questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Group&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen, provide your full attention and respect that persons time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share experiences and resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dissect and investigate further (why? more information)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage and support (energize)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips&quot;&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 Tips to for a successful MMG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be brutally honest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share how you are best motivated (so how are you best motivated)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dedicate goals meetings (2x per year)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan ahead when you are in the hot seat (don’t waste other peoples / your time)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet in person once a year (fun / fancy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start a private hub&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow up and know it’s okay to disagree&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it a priority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MMG are build through networks and connections. A good way to build your network is to go to environments were you can find like minded people such as seminars, meet ups and industry groups.  The more successful you become the easier it is to find people for your MMG&lt;/p&gt;

The Why?

“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” — Jim Rohn

The possible result of any situation will be the average of all possible outcomes. So if your aim is to become a professional table tennis player, then surround yourself with professional table tennis players. If you want to be successful then surround yourself with and successful people. A MMG is a way of surrounding yourself with like people of similar focuses ambitions and interest, increasing your changes of success.

MMG Membership

Pick your group members carefully, as the group will only be as good as the people in it. Try to choose people with different perspective and skill sets, because they will see the world in a different way and provide solutions you may not see. And only allow new members with the unanimous consent of the group.

  &lt;p&gt;All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.

&lt;p&gt;There is risk with all things in life. It cannot be avoided so do not let the possibility of failure prevent action. An indecision is still a decision. Move forward knowing that the decision you made was the right one, based on the knowledge you had at the time. Whether or not it turns out to be right is besides the point, considered action is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming successful requires risk and with risk comes mistakes. It is through these mistakes that we learn and grow. We can try and avoid risk but in the end we will make mistakes. However, there are mistakes of sloth (mistakes) and mistakes of ambition. Mistake of sloth lead to missed opportunity and regret. While, for the most part mistakes of ambition will be forgiven because they come from good intentions. Mistakes of sloth are not so easily forgiven and often it is ourselves that are the last to forget, because of our regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success for the most part is subjective, but what ever your measure may be it still requires action. It is comfortable to stay on the path of least resistance, because it is well walked. But be bold and walk the road less traveled.&lt;/p&gt;

Your love is very much appreciated and heartfelt. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on what I saw in my dad, a lot of words, character traits come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A husband&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A father&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A family man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lover&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wise man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A man with integrity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shined the light of life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had a spirit of adventure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The desire to explore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A determination&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A film maker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A hard worker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An enjoyment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Holidays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great courage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dignity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acceptance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skilled hands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finished the race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still isn’t easy to talk about my dad’s final journey and it is still a little fresh, but I think his journey with cancer illustrates well his character. The person that he was and the type of character that he was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His journey with cancer, I think can best be described as a mysterious journey of unknown certainty. Where the outcome is certain (death) but the destiny a mystery (life after death) and the path unknown (everyone is different). My dad walked this journey with great courage and strength. He was joined on this path by the enduring and never ending lover of his wife, companion and best friend. Who demonstrated great courage and strength of her own. I am extremely proud of the way both my parents carried themselves during this time. With great dignity and care for each other. Dads first concern, when diagnosed was for the well being of his family. That his wife will be taken care of and that his family will be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on during his journey as we sat around at home I asked him “What he wanted to be remembered for”. His answer “That he gave to his kids, to his family the most precious thing anyone can give, his time”. Many of the family photos found in our photo albums were taken during family holidays. This is a testament to just that, time spent with his family. I don’t think I have ever met anyone that was taken on as many family holidays as his children were. While Laura and I where honeymooning in Fiji, enjoying the weather and warm water Laura asked me “if this is the best holiday ever?” My answer, “hmmm, maybe not as good as Blowering dam”. Our family holidays are for me by fare my fondest childhood memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I have been accused of being stubborn and told “it is ok to ask for help”. This I think is one character trait I can say I shared with dad. Other words for stubborn could also be hard working, determined or finisher. All through his journey with cancer Dad was up early showering and shaving himself. He never complained about the situation he found himself in, why me. He always did for himself that what he could. He never gave up hope, sure he wavered but he always tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hear people saying “I’m not going to be like my parents”, “I’m never going to do this like my parents did”. For me my hope and prayer is that I can one day be as great a man, as great a father and husband that my dad was. As children we don’t always see the things that our parents do for us, I certainly didn’t. We just expect them to do, situation normal. However with passing of time and as I saw the way my friends interacted with their children I have began to see. To see just how much dad and just how much mum did for their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last week of his life was tough for all involved, but was a something we all went through together and choose to be part of because of our love. During this time as I sat there with dad listening to the familiar sounds of the birds outside, the sound of the wind in the trees and the unique sounds found in every house I understood why he wanted to undertake the final part of his journey at home. At home surrounded by the love of his family and in the house that he put some much of time, so much his love into. His skill full hands can be seen throughout the house. In the TV cabinet he built, in the bathroom he built, in the kitchen he built, the garage he built, the garden tendered to, everywhere. He put all that he was into his house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat there on his final day watching his irregular and labored breathing emotionally torn. As one breath was being expelled I was saying my good byes, letting him go, wanting his pain to be over for dad to find his peace. On the other breath I was willing him to keep breathing. I’m not ready, come on breath dam it! In the end the choice is not mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lives on in all of those he touched, in the valves he taught his children, the receding hair line he passed onto his sons, the love he showed his wife and the things that he made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your prayers, thoughts and gifts during this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Authoritarian (Autocratic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Participator (Democratic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Delegator (Laissez-faire)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authoritarian – rule by ones self – leader provides clear expectations for what needs to be done, when it should be completed and how to complete it. They provide vision and direction and then try to convince people to get on board. The Participator (majority rule) encourages the group members to participate, offers guidance but retains final say over the decision making. They spend time building consensus amongst the group, using that consensus to drive the direction. While the delegator (let do) offers little or no guidance to the group and leaves decision making up the group members. Kurt Lewin studied the three styles of leadership and discovered that members of an authoritarian leadership are the most productive, though members of participator leaders contributions while less productive did produce higher quality output. While members of a delegator leader often lack motivation and have poorly defined roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my personal style is part authoritarian and part participator. Properly more authoritarian then participator but I think that is a result of my drive from being goal and outcome driven. Though I also recognise the need to be a participator and get people involved and owning what they are doing. I lean away from the delegator style mainly due to the fact I believe it is important for a leader to have the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on my current frustrations I boiled my frustration down to the meetings about meetings about meetings. Did I mention there are a lot of meetings. It seemed that everything was being done through committee, which appeared to be an ineffective use of time. So when I was listening to the Podcast the comments about Bob Hawke being a leader of consensus it rang some bells and I decided to do a little more reading on leadership styles. As I reflected more on it I realised that it was the lack of productive outcomes, outputs and an apparent poor utilisation of time. The group dynamics where lending themselves towards the delegator style, causing me to have an undefined role and tasks within the group. Making me increasingly frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of balance and yin yang a good leader most be able apply all three styles and be able to identify when it is appropriate to use which style. They must be able to use the authoritative style when the group lacks knowledge, use the participative style when the group clearly understands their objectives and there roles in the task and use the delegative style when the members know more about the task at hand then they do. Participative leadership is said to be the most effective style of leadership though I think it can easily become a delegator style, the least effective, if the leader does not retain the final say over the decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="management" /><category term="leadership" /><summary>The father of leadership is arguably the psychologist Kurt Lewin, who in 1939 proposed that there are 3 styles of leadership:
