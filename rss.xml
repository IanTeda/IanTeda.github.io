  &lt;p&gt;Be in control of your destiny, by getting out in front of issues and avoiding suprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager, I want to know about the good news and the bad news. But don’t bring me surprises. Surprises indicate a lack of understanding and ownership of what you are responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule is no better illustrated then in cost forecasting. If your quantities, rates and costs continually move around. And this comes as a surprise to you, then it is a good indicator that you are not in control of your work. And keep in mind that a surprise $1 million profit, 1 month out from closing a project is still a surprise. Was it by luck or good management that you made money? Were you in control? Should we trust you with more money? You should plan for the unknown unknowns, but be transparent about any contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go wrong, everyone understands that. But there is a difference between bad news and surprises. Bad news is owning your mistakes, owning the unknowns and having a plan to mitigate any loses. Having a plan to stop the bleeding. Telling someone bad news and this is the plan, is a whole lot better then surprise we are losing money and I have no idea how much or how to mitigate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When bringing bad news about the costs, have an understanding why your quaities increased or why the rate changed. Know what the worst case is if thins are kept the sameπ – understanding the problem – and these are the changes we are making to bring the cost blow out back in – getting in front of the issue and controlling your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me good news, give me bad news. Just don’t give me surprises. No one likes surprises.

  &lt;p&gt;Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with what seem like mutually exclusive and opposing views, often the answer is both. Much of life is a dichotomy, a contradiction and construction life is no different. The skill comes in first realizing this, being comfortable with the contradictions and knowing how to find the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule 2, is a little bit of an abstract concept. But it is important as it adds context and framing to a lot of the other rules – I.e. a rule may be highlighting an extreme, but they doesn’t mean you should live there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safest way to build something is not to build it at all. But that doesn’t get things built. The answer is you need to do both. It needs to be built and it needs to be built safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I micro manage or macro manage? The answer is you should do both. There are times when you need to focus in on the detail to make sure things run smoothly, but you will get to a level of micro where the return on your time does not warrant the focus and you need to execute and step back into the macro so you can first see where you need adjust and then make the adjustment. The return is in the execution, but if you don’t but enough time into the detail the execution will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I be good cop or bad cop? The answer is both. You must be able to go to the extremes of being angry and being passive, and be able to recognise when and how to deploy each of them. But you cannot live life at the extreme of either. You need to be able to defend your ideas, but if you never change your mind people will not approach you with what could be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Rule 1 - Your job is to make money. By building it safely, building it once and leaving a positive legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to ask graduate engineers when they are starting in construction “What do think your job is?”, because it helps to orientate there thinking. It is also true for people starting in any career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your job? Your job as a construction engineer is to make money for your employer, XYZ Constructions. You are not there for practice and you are not working for XYZ Construction Charities. XYZ Constructions is paying you a salary of $X with the intention that you return $(X+1). They are looking for a return on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that reality understood, it is important to highlight that the best way to make money in construction is by building it safely, building it once (quality) and leaving a positive legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have two identical projects and on one project someone gets hurt, they have to build it twice and they allow pollution into a local river. Which project will make more money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully appreciating the personal impact to those involved in a safety incident and the negative legacy it leaves behind, if you are worried about meeting program and budget then the last thing you need is a safety incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you consider your project budget has a 10% profit built in and work gets affected for one week, then the project will need to perform at optimum efficiency for the next 100 weeks just to get out of the red and into budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to do the job safely and avoid any loss time injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting corners is a short term game, you may win once or twice but in the end probability always wins and you will have on your hands rework. So keep in mind and respect the five P’s: Prior Planning Prevents Pour Performance. By planning the works, communicating the plan, monitor performance of the plan and adapting the plan where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to do the job once and do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy is about leaving things better than the way you found them. And the legacy you leave behind is your reputation, your promise and your promise is your brand. If your clients do not trust your brand then you will soon have no work on the books. While it is important to live in the present, don’t loose focus of the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving behind a negative legacy for those that work for you, the clients that pay the bills and the community that will use what you build – which is often the case with construction projects – you will soon discover that: no one will want to work for you and you are only as good as the people that work for you; clients will not engage you and without clients there will be no money coming in; and your project will be known as the one. The one that polluted, the one that churned through employees, or the one that is going to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to make money is to leave behind a positive legacy. It is through that legacy that you add value. And if your client sees the value they will be happy to have you build something else (for the right price).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ian Teda</name><email>ian@teda.id.au</email></author><category term="engineering" /><category term="construction" /><summary type="html">Rule 1 - Your job is to make money.

  &lt;p&gt;Your beliefs become your thoughts; Your thoughts become your words; Your words become your actions; Your actions become your habits; Your habits become your values; Your values become your destiny.
&lt;cite&gt; Mahatma Ghandi.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our habits that influence our actions, and it is our actions that define our character. It is what we do, our habits, not what we say that people judge use on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good habits are hard to form, and take continuous effort to maintain. While bad habits sneak up on us by surprise, forming easily and fast. And once created habits are hard to remove, because they become hard wired into our brains by cravings. These cravings – addictions – for the reward drive the routine. Habits are like a folded piece of paper that always wants to return to the fold it knows. Habits can be your making or your undoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explored what habits are and how they work in a previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ianteda.com/creativity/the-habit-loop.html&quot;&gt;The Habit Loop&lt;/a&gt;. Pause here and give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-habits&quot;&gt;Creating Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Men’s natures are alike; it is their habits that separate them.
&lt;cite&gt; Confucius, Analects.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/habit-loop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Habit Loop&quot; title=&quot;The Habit Loop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most habits sneak up on use by surprise, because we are not aware of the cues and rewards. But habits can be intentionally formed by putting together a cue, routine, and reward. To form a new habit spend time cultivating the craving for the reward that the routine provides. This in turn will drive the habit loop and hard wire in the craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However for must of us, we already have a lifetime of habits. And these existing cues and rewards will be in direct competition with the new habits we want to form. So it is not new habits that we should concentrate on, but the modification of old ones. And this requires a different approach, an indirect one. One where we use the existing hard wired craving, but insert a new routine or habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-habits&quot;&gt;Changing Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our habits have occurred for so long that we pay little attention to them. Often not recognizing the habit loop as it forms. It seems simple, but once you understand how habits works and can recognize the cues and rewards. You are halfway to changing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-habit-modification-framework&quot;&gt;The Habit Modification Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.com/081298160X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/book-power-of-habit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business Book Cover&quot; title=&quot;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business&quot; class=&quot;book-cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.com/081298160X&quot;&gt;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business&lt;/a&gt;” Charles Duhigg proposes a framework&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:framework&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:framework&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for changing habits. I have modified it slightly into the framework below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isolate the Cue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiment with Rewards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Modification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insert a Routine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a plan (You Only have so Much Will Power)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-awareness&quot;&gt;Step 1: Awareness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most habits sneak up on use by surprise, operating in the background while we live in the future. So the first step is to increase our awareness around the habit we want to change. To better understand who we are and why we behave the way we do, start by isolating the cue and then experimenting with rewards. Through this we build up our awareness and understanding of self and why we behave the way we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate the cue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cues fit into one of five categories: time; location; emotional state; other people; or immediately preceding an action or event. To help identify the specific cue that initiates the habit, ask yourself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What time is it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where am I?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What emotion am I feeling?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who else is around?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did I just do or happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep a log of the answers to each of these questions, even if it feels meaningless. There is a lot information bombarding us as our behaviors unfold, making it hard to isolate the cue. By keeping a log it forces momentary awareness, letting you reflect on the present and what just happened. Look for patterns within your answers, because the cue is within the answer to one of the five questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the reward your habit provides and is craving is not what you think it is. The best way to identify the reward you are graving is by substituting rewards. When you observer the habit cue, substitute a reward. Is the graving gone? No! Then substitute the opposite reward. Is the graving gone? Yes! Awesome, that is what you are graving. By experimenting with different rewards, you can narrow down what you are actually craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? or is it the reward of taking a break before starting another task?  Is it the cookie itself? The change of scenery? The temporary distraction? or perhaps it is the socializing with colleagues? It might appear that the reward is the chocolate bar, but its not. It is getting up from your desk to take a break or socialise around the water bubbler that is the reward and what you are craving at 3pm in the afternoon. And going to get a chocolate bar is a way of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you test four or five different rewards, look for patterns. After each activity, log the first three things that come to mind when you get back to your desk. Test different hypotheses through substatution to determine which craving is driving your routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stage-2-modification&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Modification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have developed a good awareness of the cue and reward of the habit you want to change, the next step is to change the routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert a Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routine or behavior is usually the most obvious part of the habit, because it is the behaviour we would like to change. A good approach is to insert an opposing behavior, one that can be done for longer than a couple of minutes and is unnoticeable to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the chocolate bar example. Recognising it is the break from your work that you are graving, get up and go for a walk around the block. Is it the socialising, get up and go for a walk around the block with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness, understanding and desire isn’t enough. The will power that drives your desire for change is like a muscle. It has limited strength and endurance. But like a muscle your will power can be trained, practiced, and increased. Will power is a skill, a skill you can learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have a limit supply of will power, it is important to develop a plan, a strategy to help limit your need for willpower, increase your will power and coping mechanisms when the will power tank gets low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;100 percent&lt;/em&gt;: it is easier to say no 100% of the time then 99% of the time. Just this once, will start the old habit back up again. Be conscious of your cues and rewards and keep with the routine substitution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change it up&lt;/em&gt;: temptation is hard to resists, so if possible remove the craving by removing the cue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The donut&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jockopodcast2.com/&quot;&gt;Jocko Willink&lt;/a&gt; offers a good mental trick to increase your mental toughness, will power. When you observe the cue, say to yourself “me will power is greater than that of the donut”. Meaning if you eat the donut, you are saying that the donut an inanimate object is stronger than you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internalise&lt;/em&gt;: don’t make your goal finite, make it systems orientated. Your goal shouldn’t be to drop X kilograms, but to learn systems, processes and behaviours that will allow your body to lose weight. So even if you don’t drop X kilograms within Y months you have achieved your goal of learning more about what works for you and how you body works.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keystone&lt;/em&gt;: build habits of other habits. Break things down to small wins. Want to exercise more, work on the habit of getting up early. Then build on that by exercising first thing in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep a log&lt;/em&gt;: writing down a few words helps later when recalling what you were thinking, feeling or doing. Our brains don’t remember the whole story. They remember key events and build out the rest with our understanding of reality. That is why a smell or a place can bring up memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Watch your thoughts, they become your WORDS. Watch your words, they become you ACTIONS. Watch your actions, they become your HABITS. Watch your habits, they become your CHARACTER. Watch your character, it becomes your DESTINY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I explored what habits are and how they work in a previous post, The Habit Loop. Pause here and give it a read. Creating Habits Men’s natures are alike; it is their habits that separate them. Confucius, Analects. Most habits sneak up on use by surprise, because we are not aware of the cues and rewards. But habits can be intentionally formed by putting together a cue, routine, and reward. To form a new habit spend time cultivating the craving for the reward that the routine provides. This in turn will drive the habit loop and hard wire in the craving. Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel. However for must of us, we already have a lifetime of habits. And these existing cues and rewards will be in direct competition with the new habits we want to form. So it is not new habits that we should concentrate on, but the modification of old ones. And this requires a different approach, an indirect one. One where we use the existing hard wired craving, but insert a new routine or habit. Changing Habits Most of our habits have occurred for so long that we pay little attention to them. Often not recognizing the habit loop as it forms. It seems simple, but once you understand how habits works and can recognize the cues and rewards. You are halfway to changing them. The Habit Modification Framework In his book “The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business” Charles Duhigg proposes a framework1 for changing habits. I have modified it slightly into the framework below. Step 1: Awareness Isolate the Cue Experiment with Rewards Step 2: Modification Insert a Routine Have a plan (You Only have so Much Will Power) Step 1: Awareness Most habits sneak up on use by surprise, operating in the background while we live in the future. So the first step is to increase our awareness around the habit we want to change. To better understand who we are and why we behave the way we do, start by isolating the cue and then experimenting with rewards. Through this we build up our awareness and understanding of self and why we behave the way we do. Isolate the cue Cues fit into one of five categories: time; location; emotional state; other people; or immediately preceding an action or event. To help identify the specific cue that initiates the habit, ask yourself the following questions: What time is it? Where am I? What emotion am I feeling? Who else is around? What did I just do or happen? Keep a log of the answers to each of these questions, even if it feels meaningless. There is a lot information bombarding us as our behaviors unfold, making it hard to isolate the cue. By keeping a log it forces momentary awareness, letting you reflect on the present and what just happened. Look for patterns within your answers, because the cue is within the answer to one of the five questions. Experiment with Rewards It is likely that the reward your habit provides and is craving is not what you think it is. The best way to identify the reward you are graving is by substituting rewards. When you observer the habit cue, substitute a reward. Is the graving gone? No! Then substitute the opposite reward. Is the graving gone? Yes! Awesome, that is what you are graving. By experimenting with different rewards, you can narrow down what you are actually craving. Is it hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? or is it the reward of taking a break before starting another task? Is it the cookie itself? The change of scenery? The temporary distraction? or perhaps it is the socializing with colleagues? It might appear that the reward is the chocolate bar, but its not. It is getting up from your desk to take a break or socialise around the water bubbler that is the reward and what you are craving at 3pm in the afternoon. And going to get a chocolate bar is a way of doing that. As you test four or five different rewards, look for patterns. After each activity, log the first three things that come to mind when you get back to your desk. Test different hypotheses through substatution to determine which craving is driving your routine. Stage 2: Modification Once we have developed a good awareness of the cue and reward of the habit you want to change, the next step is to change the routine. Insert a Routine The routine or behavior is usually the most obvious part of the habit, because it is the behaviour we would like to change. A good approach is to insert an opposing behavior, one that can be done for longer than a couple of minutes and is unnoticeable to others. Taking the chocolate bar example. Recognising it is the break from your work that you are graving, get up and go for a walk around the block. Is it the socialising, get up and go for a walk around the block with a friend. Have a Plan Awareness, understanding and desire isn’t enough. The will power that drives your desire for change is like a muscle. It has limited strength and endurance. But like a muscle your will power can be trained, practiced, and increased. Will power is a skill, a skill you can learn. Because we have a limit supply of will power, it is important to develop a plan, a strategy to help limit your need for willpower, increase your will power and coping mechanisms when the will power tank gets low. Here are a few ideas: 100 percent: it is easier to say no 100% of the time then 99% of the time. Just this once, will start the old habit back up again. Be conscious of your cues and rewards and keep with the routine substitution. Change it up: temptation is hard to resists, so if possible remove the craving by removing the cue. The donut: Jocko Willink offers a good mental trick to increase your mental toughness, will power. When you observe the cue, say to yourself “me will power is greater than that of the donut”. Meaning if you eat the donut, you are saying that the donut an inanimate object is stronger than you. Internalise: don’t make your goal finite, make it systems orientated. Your goal shouldn’t be to drop X kilograms, but to learn systems, processes and behaviours that will allow your body to lose weight. So even if you don’t drop X kilograms within Y months you have achieved your goal of learning more about what works for you and how you body works. Keystone: build habits of other habits. Break things down to small wins. Want to exercise more, work on the habit of getting up early. Then build on that by exercising first thing in the morning. Keep a log: writing down a few words helps later when recalling what you were thinking, feeling or doing. Our brains don’t remember the whole story. They remember key events and build out the rest with our understanding of reality. That is why a smell or a place can bring up memories. Watch your thoughts, they become your WORDS. Watch your words, they become you ACTIONS. Watch your actions, they become your HABITS. Watch your habits, they become your CHARACTER. Watch your character, it becomes your DESTINY.

  &lt;p&gt;A habit is something you can do without thinking — which is why most of us have so many of them.
&lt;cite&gt; Frank A. Clark.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are, for the most part a collection of habits. A collection of emotional, physical and intellectual habits, systematically organised for our brains optimisation. Manifesting themselves in our character, businesses, social groups and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might appear that the choices we make each day are the product of a well thought out conscious decision, but they are not. They are habits. On its own a habit doesn’t seem like much, but as a collective they shape the way we behave and ultimately our character. “You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do.” – C.G. Jung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits allow us to undertake tasks with difficulty the first time, but then over time with increasing ease and final in a semi-autonomous mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Duhigg in his book “The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business” breaks habits down into a three-step loop, the habit loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cue: first a trigger, that tells our brain to go into automatic mode and to use routine 1423;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Routine: Now in autonomous mode, the brain steps through the pre defined 1243 routine – which can be emotional, physical or intellectual;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reward: finally, a reward reinforces the routine. Helping the brain figure out if the particular routine – loop – is worth remembering;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/habit-loop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business Book Cover&quot; title=&quot;The Power of Habit - Why we do what we do in life and business&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits emerge without permission because our brains are constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often and conserve mental energy. Any behaviour that can be reduced to a routine is one less behaviour that we must spend time and energy consciously thinking about and deciding upon. Habits free up time and energy for other matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are habits so powerful? It is because they create neurological cravings. Over time, the habit loop - cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward - becomes more and more automatic. The cue ends up being so bound up with the reward that the cue itself will trigger a craving for the reward: “the cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerge” – Charles Duhigg . Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their influence. But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subconscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits could be brought about by a craving for positive emotions, or accomplishment or relationships.  Almost all habit cues fall into one of five categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emotional state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The immediately preceding action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example every McDonald’s looks the same - the company deliberately tries to standardize stores’ architecture and what employees say to customers, so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines. The sound a Coca-Cola can makes when you open it. The foaming of your tooth paste. Why you always enter a Supermarket on the left hand side and the fresh food is first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The chains of habit are generally too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.

  &lt;p&gt;An API allows one piece of software talking to another piece of software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some terms used in this guide and there definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt; - Application Programming Interface, an interface for one piece of software to talk to another;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collection&lt;/strong&gt; - A collection of resources found at an endpoint;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer (Client)&lt;/strong&gt; - A client computer application making requests of the API;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cURL&lt;/strong&gt; - A command line tool for getting and sending files using URL syntax;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endpoint&lt;/strong&gt; - An API URL on a Server which represents either a Resource or a Collection;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granularity&lt;/strong&gt; - The level of detailed returned in the request response;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP&lt;/strong&gt; - A protocol for communicating over networks, aka the internet;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idempotent (Stateless)&lt;/strong&gt; - Side-effect free, can happen multiple times without affecting the data state;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource&lt;/strong&gt; - A single instance of an object in an endpoint request response;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REST (RESTful)&lt;/strong&gt; - Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for the design of network-based software;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSL&lt;/strong&gt; - Secure Socket Layer, the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL&lt;/strong&gt; - Uniform Resource Locator and is a reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL Segment&lt;/strong&gt; - A slash-separated piece of information in the URL;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aim&quot;&gt;AIM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this design guide is to assist in the planing and development of a REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An API is an: Application Programming Interface. An interface for one piece of software to talk to another[^concepts] and data to be shared. It is a set of endpoints for serving up data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rest-api&quot;&gt;REST API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST API is an architectural design style that follows a defined set of objectives. It was first defined by Roy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas Fielding&lt;/a&gt; in his 2000 PhD dissertation “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The REST architectural style aims to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stateless:&lt;/strong&gt; each request contains all the information needed to complete the request;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent:&lt;/strong&gt; client-server model allows for different client environments and implementations to use the API;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacheable:&lt;/strong&gt; responses define themselves as cacheable or not, improving latency, scalability and responsiveness;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granularity:&lt;/strong&gt; use the lowest possible level of deatil to satisfy as many difference requirements and use cases as possible;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure:&lt;/strong&gt; use of HTTP authorisation headers to securely send data;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulation:&lt;/strong&gt; expose only the date data you want to, in a controlled way;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;success&quot;&gt;Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful REST API, is one that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has good documentation that is easy to find;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses web standards where they make sense;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is friendly to the developer and can be explored via a browser address bar;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is simple, intuitive and consistent to make adoption not only easy but pleasant;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provides enough flexibility to power the majority of development environments;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is efficient, while maintaining a balance with other requirements;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has been developed using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API should be well documented with cURL examples with JSON responses. A cURL examples can be cut-and-pasted, removing any ambiguity regarding endpoint calls and applicable JSON responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;api-baseroot-url&quot;&gt;API BASE/ROOT URL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root or entry point into the API should be as simple as possible. Long complex URLs appear daunting. Two common API roots are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://api.example.com/*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://example.com/api/*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single root entry point should contain some basic information about the API, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information on the API version;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supported features;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of top-level collections;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of singleton resources;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A small summary of operating status;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some statistics;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A link to the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;versioning&quot;&gt;Versioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version number should refer to major releases of the API. An API is never going to be stable, change is inevitable in fact needed. What is important is how that change is managed. When third-party software applications (clients) integrate with your API, they become dependent on the availability of the API. Versioning allows for backwards compatibility and continued development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common methods for managing API versions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) in the request HTTP header;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Accept: application/com.ianteda.app-v3+json
Content-Type: application/com.ianteda.app-v3+json 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) in the URL;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide recommends option 2. Having the API version in the endpoint URL, it is obvious and human readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All API requests and responses should be over SSL (HTTPS). Do not redirect non-SSL requests to the SSL endpoint, as this can leak information. Instead throw an API error response when the request comes over non-SSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the use of Webtokens, SSL simplifies the authentication model. Never use a custom authentication protocol, stick to the standards like &lt;a href=&quot;https://oauth.net/2/&quot;&gt;Oauth 2&lt;/a&gt;. Webtokens means the users state (authentication) is kept on the user end, sot that every request can be authenticated against the webtokens. This avoids server session states, sticking to the REST stateless server principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access within the API should be based on the resource not the endpoint URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use request rate limiting to the endpoints, to avoid performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind when providing authentication responses that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;401 “Unauthorized”&lt;/strong&gt; - Really means unauthenticated. You need valid credentials for me to respond to this request;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;403 “Forbidden”&lt;/strong&gt; - Really means unauthorized. I understood your credentials, but sorry, you are not allowed to access that resource;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;error-messages&quot;&gt;Error Messages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When responding with an error the JSON body should return a useful error message, a unique internal error code with reference to documentation, a detailed description and a 400 http status. Error messages should be human-readable from the browser, include a diagnostic message to help the consumer resolve the error condition and be as descriptive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Status: 400 BAD REQUEST
{
  &quot;code&quot; : unique_project_code,
  &quot;property&quot; : &quot;What caused the error&quot;,
  &quot;message&quot; : &quot;Something bad has happened :(&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot; : &quot;More details about the error here&quot;,
  &quot;developer_message : &quot;Extra information to help resolve the error response&quot;,
  &quot;documentation_url&quot;: &quot;https://ianteda.com/api/documentation&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;endpoints&quot;&gt;Endpoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Endpoint rules to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nouns&lt;/strong&gt; - Always represent endpoints with nouns, not verbs;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plurals&lt;/strong&gt; - Always use the plural of the noun. It avoids confusing pluralisation such as person and people;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical&lt;/strong&gt; - Endpoints should make sense from the perspective of the API consumer. Aka developer, not the data model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not one-to-one&lt;/strong&gt; - Endpoints don’t necessarily need to or make sense to map one-to-one to the data (database) model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt; - Endpoint actions should be verbs;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;down case&lt;/strong&gt; - Down case end points and actions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snake Case&lt;/strong&gt; - Use snake_case;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Path&lt;/strong&gt; - In your responses provide a link to the fully qualified canoncial API path;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Created&lt;/strong&gt; - When posting (creation and update) to an endpoint the response should return the resource created;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names and IDs&lt;/strong&gt; - Accept Ids and names in endpoint requests;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Nesting&lt;/strong&gt; - Limit endpoint nesting;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Readable&lt;/strong&gt; - The API response should  be human readable, pretty print by default. i.e. Do not remove white space;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GZip&lt;/strong&gt; - Compress responses, since we are going pretty print response with whitespaces;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cache&lt;/strong&gt; - Cache responses with ETag and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Type&lt;/strong&gt; - Use Media Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion&lt;/strong&gt; - Keep response as small as possible with links to expansion (or materialisation);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; - Each endpoint should provide a link to its documentation;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boolean&lt;/strong&gt; - Treat boolean actions on a resource as a sub resource. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PUT /resource/{key}/activate&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granularity:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep resource detail to the lowest practical level with links to expansion;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Endpoing Query:&lt;/strong&gt; Create an endpoint for multiple resource queries, such as search;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; - Keep track of the version/endpoints of your API being used by Consumers;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response Output&lt;/strong&gt; - Use JSON;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;actions&quot;&gt;Actions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical actions on an endpoint&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;URI end point&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Returns a list of all the resources in the collection. By default items in the list are a minimal representation of themselves&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Returns the full content of the resource identified by the given key (name or id)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;POST&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create a new resource&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;PUT&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Update a resource identified by the given key (name or id)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;PATCH&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Partially update a resource identified by the given key (name or id)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;DELTE&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Delete a resource identified by the given key (name or id)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;one-to-many-relationships&quot;&gt;One to many relationships&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Relationships exist within a resource, extend the endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;URI end point&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}/relationship&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Retrieve a list of relationships for the resource {key (name or id)}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}/relationship/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Retrieve relationship {key} (name or id) for a given resource {key (name or id)}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;POST&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}/relationship&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create a new relationship for a given resource {key (name or id)}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;PUT&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}/relationship/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Update relationship {key} (name or ide) for ticket {key (name or id)}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;PATCH&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}/relationship/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Partially update relationship {key (name or id)} for resource {key (name or id)}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;DELETE&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;/resource/{key}/relationship/{key}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Delete relationship {key (name or id)} for resource {key (name or id)}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;many-to-many-relationships&quot;&gt;Many to many relationships&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the relationship exists external to a resource, provide an end point for the relationship. With a href link within the resource response to the relationship. By creating an endpoint for the relationship it can be deleted without deleting the resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;provide-request-ids-for-introspection&quot;&gt;Provide Request-Ids for Introspection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include a Request-Id header in each API response, populated with a UUID value. By logging these values on the client, server and any backing services, it provides a mechanism to trace, diagnose and debug requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pagination&quot;&gt;Pagination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divide large responses across multiple requests with pagination. Using offset and limit parameters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;../resource?offset=50&amp;amp;limit=25&lt;/code&gt; - Will return a response starting from 50 of the next 25 resource items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provide links within the paged response to other pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;first&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/resource/00001&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;previous&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/resource/34523&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;next&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/resource/34525&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;last&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/resource/8764534&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;index : {
    00001: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/resource?offset=0&amp;amp;limit=25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;,
    00002: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/resource?offset=25&amp;amp;limit=25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;,
    00003: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;/resource?offset=50&amp;amp;limit=25&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;parameters&quot;&gt;Parameters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex result filters, sorting and searching can all be easily implemented as query parameters on top of the resource URL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;filtering&quot;&gt;Filtering&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a unique query parameter for each field that implements filtering. When requesting a list of resources from the /resources endpoint the default should be the smallest practical, say those in the open state. Provide a mechanism to return all &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET /resources?state=all&lt;/code&gt; or those closed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET /resources?state=closed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;sorting&quot;&gt;Sorting&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the a generic parameter such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?sort=&lt;/code&gt; to describe sorting rules for a resource endpoint. Accommodate complex sorting requirements with a list of comma separated fields, each with a possible unary negative for descending order or positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET /resources?sort=-priority&lt;/code&gt; - Responds with a list of resources in descending order of priority field&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GET /resources?sort=-priority,created_at&lt;/code&gt; - Responds with a list of resources in descending order of priority.  With older resources within the priority being first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;searching&quot;&gt;Searching&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes basic filters is not enough and you need the power of full text search. Use a query parameter on the resources endpoint &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?query=search term&lt;/code&gt;. Search queries should be passed straight to the search engine and API output should be in the same format as a normal list result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the API experience more pleasant for the average consumer, consider packaging up sets of query conditions into easily accessible endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;http-status-codes&quot;&gt;HTTP status codes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP status codes can help your consumers navigate your API. Providing context to the API responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful list of API HTTP status codes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;OK&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Response to a successful GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE. Can also be used for a POST that doesn’t result in a creation&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;201&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Created&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Response to a POST that results in a creation. Should be combined with a Location header pointing to the location of the new resource&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;204&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No Content&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Response to a successful request that won’t be returning a body (like a DELETE request)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;304&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Not Modified&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Used when HTTP caching headers are in play&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bad Request&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The request is malformed, such as if the body does not parse&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;401&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Unauthorized&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When no or invalid authentication details are provided. Also useful to trigger an auth popup if the API is used from a browser&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;403&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Forbidden&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn’t have access to the resource&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;404&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Not Found&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When a non-existent resource is requested&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;405&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Method Not Allowed&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When an HTTP method is being requested that isn’t allowed for the authenticated user&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;410&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Gone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Indicates that the resource at this end point is no longer available. Useful as a blanket response for old API versions&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;415&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Unsupported Media Type&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If incorrect content type was provided as part of the request&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;422&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Unprocessable Entity&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Used for validation errors&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;429&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Too Many Requests&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When a request is rejected due to rate limiting&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

URL Segment - A slash-separated piece of information in the URL; AIM The aim of this design guide is to assist in the planing and development of a REST API. Overview An API is an: Application Programming Interface. An interface for one piece of software to talk to another[^concepts] and data to be shared. It is a set of endpoints for serving up data. REST API REST API is an architectural design style that follows a defined set of objectives. It was first defined by Roy Thomas Fielding in his 2000 PhD dissertation “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures”. The REST architectural style aims to be: Stateless: each request contains all the information needed to complete the request; Independent: client-server model allows for different client environments and implementations to use the API; Cacheable: responses define themselves as cacheable or not, improving latency, scalability and responsiveness; Granularity: use the lowest possible level of deatil to satisfy as many difference requirements and use cases as possible; Secure: use of HTTP authorisation headers to securely send data; Encapsulation: expose only the date data you want to, in a controlled way; Success A successful REST API, is one that: Has good documentation that is easy to find; Uses web standards where they make sense; Is friendly to the developer and can be explored via a browser address bar; Is simple, intuitive and consistent to make adoption not only easy but pleasant; Provides enough flexibility to power the majority of development environments; Is efficient, while maintaining a balance with other requirements; Has been developed using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles Documentation The API should be well documented with cURL examples with JSON responses. A cURL examples can be cut-and-pasted, removing any ambiguity regarding endpoint calls and applicable JSON responses. API BASE/ROOT URL The root or entry point into the API should be as simple as possible. Long complex URLs appear daunting. Two common API roots are: https://api.example.com/* https://example.com/api/* The single root entry point should contain some basic information about the API, such as: Information on the API version; Supported features; A list of top-level collections; A list of singleton resources; A small summary of operating status; Some statistics; A link to the documentation Versioning The version number should refer to major releases of the API. An API is never going to be stable, change is inevitable in fact needed. What is important is how that change is managed. When third-party software applications (clients) integrate with your API, they become dependent on the availability of the API. Versioning allows for backwards compatibility and continued development. There are two common methods for managing API versions: 1) in the request HTTP header; Accept: application/com.ianteda.app-v3+json Content-Type: application/com.ianteda.app-v3+json 2) in the URL; GET https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint This guide recommends option 2. Having the API version in the endpoint URL, it is obvious and human readable. Security All API requests and responses should be over SSL (HTTPS). Do not redirect non-SSL requests to the SSL endpoint, as this can leak information. Instead throw an API error response when the request comes over non-SSL. With the use of Webtokens, SSL simplifies the authentication model. Never use a custom authentication protocol, stick to the standards like Oauth 2. Webtokens means the users state (authentication) is kept on the user end, sot that every request can be authenticated against the webtokens. This avoids server session states, sticking to the REST stateless server principle. Access within the API should be based on the resource not the endpoint URL. Use request rate limiting to the endpoints, to avoid performance issues. Keep in mind when providing authentication responses that: 401 “Unauthorized” - Really means unauthenticated. You need valid credentials for me to respond to this request; 403 “Forbidden” - Really means unauthorized. I understood your credentials, but sorry, you are not allowed to access that resource; Error Messages When responding with an error the JSON body should return a useful error message, a unique internal error code with reference to documentation, a detailed description and a 400 http status. Error messages should be human-readable from the browser, include a diagnostic message to help the consumer resolve the error condition and be as descriptive as possible. Status: 400 BAD REQUEST { &quot;code&quot; : unique_project_code, &quot;property&quot; : &quot;What caused the error&quot;, &quot;message&quot; : &quot;Something bad has happened :(&quot;, &quot;description&quot; : &quot;More details about the error here&quot;, &quot;developer_message : &quot;Extra information to help resolve the error response&quot;, &quot;documentation_url&quot;: &quot;https://ianteda.com/api/documentation&quot; } Endpoints Rules Some Endpoint rules to keep in mind: Nouns - Always represent endpoints with nouns, not verbs; Plurals - Always use the plural of the noun. It avoids confusing pluralisation such as person and people; Logical - Endpoints should make sense from the perspective of the API consumer. Aka developer, not the data model; Not one-to-one - Endpoints don’t necessarily need to or make sense to map one-to-one to the data (database) model; Actions - Endpoint actions should be verbs; down case - Down case end points and actions; Snake Case - Use snake_case; Full Path - In your responses provide a link to the fully qualified canoncial API path; Resource Created - When posting (creation and update) to an endpoint the response should return the resource created; Names and IDs - Accept Ids and names in endpoint requests; Limit Nesting - Limit endpoint nesting; Human Readable - The API response should be human readable, pretty print by default. i.e. Do not remove white space; GZip - Compress responses, since we are going pretty print response with whitespaces; Cache - Cache responses with ETag and Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate; Media Type - Use Media Type Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8; Expansion - Keep response as small as possible with links to expansion (or materialisation); Documentation - Each endpoint should provide a link to its documentation; Boolean - Treat boolean actions on a resource as a sub resource. PUT /resource/{key}/activate; Granularity: Keep resource detail to the lowest practical level with links to expansion; Multiple Endpoing Query: Create an endpoint for multiple resource queries, such as search; Analytics - Keep track of the version/endpoints of your API being used by Consumers; Response Output - Use JSON; Actions Typical actions on an endpoint Method URI end point Notes GET /resource Returns a list of all the resources in the collection. By default items in the list are a minimal representation of themselves GET /resource/{key} Returns the full content of the resource identified by the given key (name or id) POST /resource Create a new resource PUT /resource/{key} Update a resource identified by the given key (name or id) PATCH /resource/{key} Partially update a resource identified by the given key (name or id) DELTE /resource/{key} Delete a resource identified by the given key (name or id) Relationships One to many relationships If Relationships exist within a resource, extend the endpoint. Method URI end point Notes GET /resource/{key}/relationship Retrieve a list of relationships for the resource {key (name or id)} GET /resource/{key}/relationship/{key} Retrieve relationship {key} (name or id) for a given resource {key (name or id)} POST /resource/{key}/relationship Create a new relationship for a given resource {key (name or id)} PUT /resource/{key}/relationship/{key} Update relationship {key} (name or ide) for ticket {key (name or id)} PATCH /resource/{key}/relationship/{key} Partially update relationship {key (name or id)} for resource {key (name or id)} DELETE /resource/{key}/relationship/{key} Delete relationship {key (name or id)} for resource {key (name or id)} Many to many relationships If the relationship exists external to a resource, provide an end point for the relationship. With a href link within the resource response to the relationship. By creating an endpoint for the relationship it can be deleted without deleting the resource. Provide Request-Ids for Introspection Include a Request-Id header in each API response, populated with a UUID value. By logging these values on the client, server and any backing services, it provides a mechanism to trace, diagnose and debug requests. Pagination Divide large responses across multiple requests with pagination. Using offset and limit parameters ../resource?offset=50&amp;amp;limit=25 - Will return a response starting from 50 of the next 25 resource items. Provide links within the paged response to other pages. { &quot;first&quot; : &quot;/resource/00001&quot;, &quot;previous&quot; : &quot;/resource/34523&quot;, &quot;next&quot; : &quot;/resource/34525&quot;, &quot;last&quot; : &quot;/resource/8764534&quot;, &quot;index : { 00001: &quot;/resource?offset=0&amp;amp;limit=25&quot;, 00002: &quot;/resource?offset=25&amp;amp;limit=25&quot;, 00003: &quot;/resource?offset=50&amp;amp;limit=25&quot; } } Parameters Complex result filters, sorting and searching can all be easily implemented as query parameters on top of the resource URL Filtering Use a unique query parameter for each field that implements filtering. When requesting a list of resources from the /resources endpoint the default should be the smallest practical, say those in the open state. Provide a mechanism to return all GET /resources?state=all or those closed GET /resources?state=closed Sorting Use the a generic parameter such as ?sort= to describe sorting rules for a resource endpoint. Accommodate complex sorting requirements with a list of comma separated fields, each with a possible unary negative for descending order or positive. GET /resources?sort=-priority - Responds with a list of resources in descending order of priority field GET /resources?sort=-priority,created_at - Responds with a list of resources in descending order of priority. With older resources within the priority being first. Searching Sometimes basic filters is not enough and you need the power of full text search. Use a query parameter on the resources endpoint ?query=search term. Search queries should be passed straight to the search engine and API output should be in the same format as a normal list result. To make the API experience more pleasant for the average consumer, consider packaging up sets of query conditions into easily accessible endpoints. HTTP status codes HTTP status codes can help your consumers navigate your API. Providing context to the API responses. Useful list of API HTTP status codes Code Status Notes 200 OK Response to a successful GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE. Can also be used for a POST that doesn’t result in a creation 201 Created Response to a POST that results in a creation. Should be combined with a Location header pointing to the location of the new resource 204 No Content Response to a successful request that won’t be returning a body (like a DELETE request) 304 Not Modified Used when HTTP caching headers are in play 400 Bad Request The request is malformed, such as if the body does not parse 401 Unauthorized When no or invalid authentication details are provided. Also useful to trigger an auth popup if the API is used from a browser 403 Forbidden When authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn’t have access to the resource 404 Not Found When a non-existent resource is requested 405 Method Not Allowed When an HTTP method is being requested that isn’t allowed for the authenticated user 410 Gone Indicates that the resource at this end point is no longer available. Useful as a blanket response for old API versions 415 Unsupported Media Type If incorrect content type was provided as part of the request 422 Unprocessable Entity Used for validation errors 429 Too Many Requests When a request is rejected due to rate limiting References 10 Design Tips For APIs Application programming interface Best Practices for a Pragmatic RESTful API Beautiful REST &amp;amp; JSON APIs How to design a REST API Representational state transfer REST API Design - Resource Modeling REST API concepts and examples Thoughts on RESTful API Design What Exactly is RESTful Programming</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Turtle Mindset</title><link href="https://ianteda.com/management/the-turtle-mindset.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Turtle Mindset" /><published>2016-07-01T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-07-01T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://ianteda.com/management/the-turtle-mindset</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ianteda.com/management/the-turtle-mindset.html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Turtles carry their homes on their backs.” Running her finger over the tattoo, she tells him what her dad told her: “They’re exposed and hidden at the same time. They’re a symbol of strength and perseverance.”
&lt;cite&gt; – Christina Baker Kline&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Aesop’s Fables “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare&quot;&gt;The Tortoise and the Hare&lt;/a&gt;”, the turtle wins the race not by aiming for big (fast) wins, instead he stays on his path with a single minded focus. Soon overtaking the hare, one little win at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to the concept of winning by not losing early in my engineering career, when explained the relationship between costs, quality and profits. Say you are building widgets for $97 (cost) and are selling them for $100 (revenue). Making $3 (profit) per widget. You discover one of the widgets needs $9 of rework to fix a defect (quality). To draw even, or not lose money in your widget making venture you will need to make the next three widgets defect free. Another way to think of it, is that you are using the profits from the next three widgets to fix the defect. The moral of the story: build things right (quality), build things once (cost) and you will make money (profits). You lose money when you have to come back and fix mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people wouldn’t call gambling on a horse race an investment and so at this point I think it is important to separate investing from speculation. Just like business, personal investing is a marathon, not a sprint and you cannot win a marathon by going backwards. Successful long-term investing has more to do with avoiding loses then capturing unrealised gains&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:great&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:great&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Chasing +10 percent profits is speculation, a gamble not investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you invest $100,000 from your widget profits, but the investment doesn’t workout as planned and you lose $10,000. Taking a 10 percent loss. You reinvest the remaining $90,000 hoping to draw even with your original $100,000 investment. To draw even you need make $10,000 from a $90,000 investment, an 11 percent gain. And it gets exponentially worse as losses increase. A 20% loss will require a 25% gain and so on&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:reckoning&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:reckoning&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
&lt;cite&gt; – GEORGE BERNHARD SHAW&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life isn’t something you chip away at until you find your passion waiting inside. Life is something you build upon slowly over time, it is something you create&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:tim-ferris&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:tim-ferris&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So instead of discovering yourself, create yourself. Become a master craftsman of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t want to find their passion. It’s a romantic notion afterall. That inside you is a vocation you will love, that will bring you happiness and a fulfilling life. You just need the courage to search for it. But the question “What do I truly love?” rarely boils down to a yes-or-no answer. And as such, it will leave you confused and lost. “I want to be happy, I just need to keep looking”, is a mantra that will keep you perpetually looking and as a result unhappy about where you are. It will cause you to burn energy trying to figure out your passion, instead of building career capital in your craft. If Steve Jobs hand followed his own advice he would have picked apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To find yourself, think for yourself.
&lt;cite&gt; — SOCRATES&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life doesn’t owe you happiness. It doesn’t owe you a successful, meaningful and rewarding career. You have to work for it, you need to earn it. By refining your craft, becoming a master craftsman. Being so good they can’t ignore you. Put aside the question of a true passion and focus on becoming good. It isn’t about you, it’s about what you can do for the world. The passion, satisfaction and enjoyment will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1reowPn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/book-so-good.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;So Good They Can't Ignore You - Book Cover&quot; title=&quot;So Good They Can't Ignore You - Book Cover&quot; class=&quot;book-cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So Good They Can’t Ignore You” by &lt;a href=&quot;http://calnewport.com/&quot;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; defines people who have meaningful careers as having the following traits in there work&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:so-good&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:so-good&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;: Control over their day. What they work on and their priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competency&lt;/strong&gt;: They are good at what they do, and find it easy to do their work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect&lt;/strong&gt;: People openly acknowledgement their skills and look to them for answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is surprisingly hard to get people to give you money. If you want something rare and valuable - i.e. a successful, meaningful and rewarding career - you need something rare and valuable to trade in exchange and that commodity is your skills. The more experiences you have, the bigger your collections of mental models becomes&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mental&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mental&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And the more you are going to love your work because it will be easy, people will respect you and in return they will give you more autonomy. Focus on mastering the skills you can trade. You need to be good at what you do to get good things from your work&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:youtube&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastery however is not enough, just look at the miserable workaholics. It is how you invest the fruits of those skills to build for you a meaningful and rewarding life. Be so good they can’t ignore you. So they will give you the autonomy and respect. Like a continuous feed back loop, the more experience you have the more you are going to enjoy your work, the more experience you will get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t mistake passion for an idea, with passion for work. Passion for an idea will not get you anywhere without passion for work, for the process&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:seal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:seal&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But hard work isn’t enough. There are lots of hardworking people that are not unhappy. What are they missing? They haven’t figured out how to cash in some of that career capital for autonomy, and what do with that it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a master craftsman take on an apprenticeship&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mind&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mind&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for guidance, look to roles models for direction, be uncomfortable with growth and be patient (see “&lt;a href=&quot;/management/the-turtle-mindset.html&quot;&gt;The Turtle Mindset&lt;/a&gt;”).

Life is about creating yourself. – GEORGE BERNHARD SHAW Life isn’t something you chip away at until you find your passion waiting inside. Life is something you build upon slowly over time, it is something you create1. So instead of discovering yourself, create yourself. Become a master craftsman of your life. Who doesn’t want to find their passion. It’s a romantic notion afterall. That inside you is a vocation you will love, that will bring you happiness and a fulfilling life. You just need the courage to search for it. But the question “What do I truly love?” rarely boils down to a yes-or-no answer. And as such, it will leave you confused and lost. “I want to be happy, I just need to keep looking”, is a mantra that will keep you perpetually looking and as a result unhappy about where you are. It will cause you to burn energy trying to figure out your passion, instead of building career capital in your craft. If Steve Jobs hand followed his own advice he would have picked apples. To find yourself, think for yourself. — SOCRATES Life doesn’t owe you happiness. It doesn’t owe you a successful, meaningful and rewarding career. You have to work for it, you need to earn it. By refining your craft, becoming a master craftsman. Being so good they can’t ignore you. Put aside the question of a true passion and focus on becoming good. It isn’t about you, it’s about what you can do for the world. The passion, satisfaction and enjoyment will follow. “So Good They Can’t Ignore You” by Cal Newport defines people who have meaningful careers as having the following traits in there work2 : Autonomy: Control over their day. What they work on and their priorities. Competency: They are good at what they do, and find it easy to do their work. Respect: People openly acknowledgement their skills and look to them for answers. It is surprisingly hard to get people to give you money. If you want something rare and valuable - i.e. a successful, meaningful and rewarding career - you need something rare and valuable to trade in exchange and that commodity is your skills. The more experiences you have, the bigger your collections of mental models becomes3. And the more you are going to love your work because it will be easy, people will respect you and in return they will give you more autonomy. Focus on mastering the skills you can trade. You need to be good at what you do to get good things from your work4. Mastery however is not enough, just look at the miserable workaholics.

  &lt;p&gt;Start by knowing what you want and who you are, build credibility around it and deliver it online in a compelling way.
&lt;cite&gt; — Krista Neher&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-are-a-brand&quot;&gt;You are a brand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not branding yourself, others are doing it for you. Going to a job interview, leasing a house or doing business then your name will be googled. Personal branding is about managing your name in a world of misinformation, disinformation, and semi-permanent Google records&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:tim-ferriss&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:tim-ferriss&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “We are CEOs of our own companies: Me Inc.”, Tom Peters at Fast Company&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fast-company&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fast-company&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal branding is about telling your story (1), letting the world know what you stand for (2) and building credibility (trust) around it (3). Think of your personal brand as what people say about you when you leave the room&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:dorie-clark&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:dorie-clark&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1---your-story&quot;&gt;1 - Your Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If people like you they will listen to you, but if they trust you, they’ll do business with you.
&lt;cite&gt; — Zig Ziglar&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your story is the proof, the walk behind your talk. It demonstrates who you are and what you believe in. When telling your story don’t create two worlds be authentic, it is easier to remember. People will see through your false world, discard what you say and not trust you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2---your-values&quot;&gt;2 - Your Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If people believe they share values with a company, they will stay loyal to the brand.
&lt;cite&gt; — Howard Schultz&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People buy the brand not the product. In the same way people will buy into you, not what you say. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:start-with-why&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:start-with-why&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Why should someone trust you? What code to you live by?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3---build-credibility&quot;&gt;3 - Build Credibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.
&lt;cite&gt; — Seth Godin&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building credibility is about continuing your story, sharing your thoughts and putting yourself out there. It builds your personal trust, authenticity and authority. A common way to build credibility is to blog (write). Put into words what you believe, think or notice about the world and then put a URL to it for others to read. You could also try doing a vlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-your-personal-brand&quot;&gt;Building your Personal Brand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to effective thinking is asking the right questions. Below is a list of questions to help develop your personal brand. I used the questions below to develop my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ianteda.com&quot;&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; and develop content for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-story&quot;&gt;Your Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What aspects of your life have been rewarding or you are proud to tell your mum?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are you passionate about? What makes you angry? What do you care about?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are you good at? What are your super powers? What skills have you spent time developing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What tagline summaries your story?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-values&quot;&gt;Your Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What values do you live by? What priority do you put on those values?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hint: Think of your values as your character. Describe yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are your ideal character traits?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What three people do you admire? Take a deeper look at their lives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-credibility&quot;&gt;Your Credibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What content can you create? Hint: Take a look at your values.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can you add value through your content?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create good content, don’t chase views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Man seeks for himself a simplified and lucid image of the world.
&lt;cite&gt; – Albert Einstein&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental models simplify the world around us so we can make sense of our surroundings. They are an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction&quot;&gt;abstraction&lt;/a&gt; of reality, a simplification of an incomprehensibly world so our limited cognitive capabilities can process all our inputs without overload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to explore and better understand mental models and what better way to understand a topic then to try to explain it to someone else. So I sat down and wrote this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental models are a set of tools (maps) our brains use to think and make decisions. A personal algorithm to process and make sense of the world around us. We use them to predict the results of our actions or those of others. Since they are a simplifications they don’t always hold true for all situations, contexts or moments in time. Because they represent (model) what is explicitly true, but not what is explicitly false. The world around us is continually changing, so should our mental models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We form Mental models either through direct, or shared experiences. We can see them in our and societies prejudices, beliefs, folklore and proverbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do people with more experience get the job? Because they have more mental models to guide them. When your set of mental models is limited, so is your potential for finding a solution. The decision maker without a mental model to apply is overwhelmed &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:creative-advatage&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:creative-advatage&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, we cannot function without them. We abstract away complexity and understanding when we hire a plumber, visit a doctor or engage a lawyer. Why? Because it would take a long time to learn all the knowledge and skills needed to be plumber, doctor and lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government[s] or [countries]. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system.
&lt;cite&gt; – Jay Wright Forrester&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.createadvantage.com/glossary/mental-model&quot;&gt;Creative Advantage&lt;/a&gt; they list four general problems with mental models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, they could be wrong because they are limited by the simplifications that made them useful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, they could be improperly used&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third, they could lead to wrong answers if fed by incorrect information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fourth, their effectiveness is rarely assessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
&lt;cite&gt; – Abraham Maslow&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you master a single mental model, the more likely this mental model will be your downfall. Knowledge is about connections, connections between mental models. Wisdom is the application of that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
