A MMG is not a group coaching session but can be thought of as a peer advisory board that meets with the aim of sharpening the groups personal and business skills so they can achieve optimum outcomes.</p><p><a href="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1585424331&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=iate-20"><img src="/assets/images/think-and-grow-rich.jpg" alt="Think and Grow Rich - Book Cover" title="Think and Grow Rich - Book Cover"></a></p><h3 id="the-why">The Why?</h3><p>“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” — Jim Rohn</p><p>The possible result of any situation will be the average of all possible outcomes. So if your aim is to become a professional table tennis player, then surround yourself with professional table tennis players. If you want to be successful then surround yourself with and successful people. A MMG is a way of surrounding yourself with like people of similar focuses ambitions and interest, increasing your changes of success. Both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison saw the benefits and were involved in MMGs.</p><p>Don’t reinvent the wheel, you are not the first person to aspire to be a professional table tennis player. MMG help you focus, shape or throw out ideas while increasing your confidence that you’ve made the right decisions and are taking correct actions. While providing inspiration and shared success stories, so you know it can be done.</p><p>A MMG should be place of unbiased ideas, unbiased respectful opinions, encouragement, inspiration, shared resources and accountability. It should not be about chit chat and gossip but focused on your growth and the growth of others in the group through the collective brain power. To paraphrase Napoleon Hill, success is planned and earned the only limitation you have is the one you accept in your own mind.</p><h3 id="what-is-in-a-name">What is in a name?</h3><p>A name and description helps set the purpose and make clear the groups objective and helps ensure it is formed around people striving for a common purpose, but not necessarily with common perspectives. Hearing different views helps you see the forest from the trees. It is not always easy to see your own problems they way others do. It is important to have people with similar drive, commitment and be in the same place in business/life so that everyone gets something from the MGG and the input doesn’t become lop sided.</p><h3 id="mmg-membership">MMG Membership</h3><p>Pick your group members carefully, as the group will only be as good as the people in it. Try to choose people with different perspective and skill sets, because they will see the world in a different way and provide solutions you may not see. And only allow new members with the unanimous consent of the group.</p><p>Be prepared to ask a member to leave the group if they are not up to the standard of participation and do it quickly once the poor behaviour becomes evident. A “slacking” member will bring down the energy and fun level of the whole group.</p><h3 id="create-habits-by-creating-rules">Create habits by creating rules</h3><p>A set of rules will help the group know what is expected of them, avoid disappointment and provide understanding about their return on their investment (time), after all the group needs to work for everyone. If someone is not a good fit for the group (i.e. not meeting expectations), then a set of rules — not followed — makes a hard conversation about someone leaving easier.</p><p>6 Rules to create habits:</p><ol><li>Rules are never forever (change where needed).</li><li>Group size should stay at 2 to 5 people to provide opportunity for all to speak and be listened to.</li><li>New members may only come in to the group with unanimous consent after a test in the hot seat.</li><li>Respect other peoples time. Don’t miss meetings and be on time.</li><li>What happens in the MMG stays in the MMG — it is a sacred place</li><li>Be willing to dissect and be dissected</li></ol><h3 id="meet-regularly-and-precisely">Meet Regularly and Precisely</h3><p>Keep to a regularly scheduled time and ensure all members are punctual and that meetings end on time. Give each member equal time and capture what happens at each meeting: lessons and triumphs; goals; and items you want to keep each other accountable to.</p><p>Assuming a 60 minute meeting, a meeting will start with a 10 minute round table where everyone shares wins they have had — preferable from there previous meetings goals. This sets a positive tone for the meeting and gets the blood pumping. Followed by a 40 minute hot seat where one member presents a problem or business idea they are working on and the group provides feed back and advice on how to move forward. To close out the meeting a second 10 minute round table where the MMG share goals for the following period.</p><h3 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h3><p>Each meeting needs three roles, that are rotated each week: The facilitator, the hot seat and the group. The each have different responsibilities:</p><p>The Facilitator</p><ul><li>The person from last weeks hot seat</li><li>Keep track of time</li><li>Direct the conversation</li><li>Prompt the quiet ones</li></ul><p>The Hot Seat</p><ul><li>Present a problem or issue</li><li>Talk about current or upcoming projects</li><li>Present a recent finding or discovery</li><li>Ask specific (direction) questions</li></ul><p>The Group</p><ul><li>Listen, provide your full attention and respect that persons time</li><li>Share experiences and resources</li><li>Dissect and investigate further (why? more information)</li><li>Encourage and support (energize)</li></ul><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>9 Tips to for a successful MMG:</p><ol><li>Be brutally honest</li><li>Share how you are best motivated (so how are you best motivated)</li><li>Dedicate goals meetings (2x per year)</li><li>Plan ahead when you are in the hot seat (don’t waste other peoples / your time)</li><li>Meet in person once a year (fun / fancy)</li><li>Start a private hub</li><li>Follow up and know it’s okay to disagree</li><li>Make it a priority</li><li>Create rules</li></ol><h3 id="building-a-mmg">Building a MMG</h3><p>MMG are build through networks and connections. A good way to build your network is to go to environments were you can find like minded people such as seminars, meet ups and industry groups.
